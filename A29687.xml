            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Philoſophers ſpeaking of happineſs, were divided into two hundred eighty eight opinions, every one intending ſomething, yet reſolving upon nothing; and therefore the man in <hi>Plutarch</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them wrangle about <hi>(ſummum bonum)</hi> the chiefeſt good, one placing of it in this, and another in that, went to the Market and bought up all that was good, hoping that among all he ſhould not miſs of happineſs, and yet he miſt it; true happineſs being too great and too glorious a thing to be found in any thing below real holineſs.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:104351:3"/>
            <p>All men in the general deſire to be happy, but all men do not deſire in this or that particular, or in this or that way to be happy; here there is an infinite difference, <hi>quot homines tot ſententiae,</hi> ſo many men ſo many minds.</p>
            <p>A deſire of happineſs is planted in all men by the conſtitution of nature; this is ſo intrinſecal, and ſo innate in nature, it is ſo ingraven in it, that even the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> as great as it was, hath not blotted it out.</p>
            <p>This deſire of happineſs is left in man for a ſtock to graft holineſs on: God grafts the plant of Grace upon the ſtock of nature.<note place="margin">Gen. 29.20. to the 27.</note> Indeed Happineſs, like <hi>Rachel,</hi> is ſo fair and ſo beautiful a thing, that every one is apt to fall in love with it, and earneſtly to deſire it; yea many there be, that would ſerve twice ſeven years to enjoy it; but by the ſtanding Law of that heavenly Countrey above, the younger ſiſter muſt never be beſtowed before the elder; you can never enjoy fair <hi>Rachel,</hi> Heaven and Happineſs, except you are firſt married to tender-eyed <hi>Leah,</hi> real holineſs; he that will have heaven, muſt have union and communion with Chriſt: and he that will have union and communion with Chriſt,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.14, 15.</note> muſt be holy. <hi>For what fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip hath righteouſneſs with unrighteouſneſs? and what communion hath light with darkneſs? And what concord hath Chriſt with</hi> Belial? Of all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands that have travelled to happineſs, there is not one to be found but hath travelled thither in a way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. Now the drift, the ſcope of this following Treatiſe, is to make men holy, that they may be happy: it is to make men gracious on earth, that they may be glorious in heaven. Now to prevent all miſtakes, raſh cenſures and miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, I judge it very convenient and neceſſary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I go any further, to acquaint the Reader plainly and
<pb facs="tcp:104351:3"/> honeſtly with thoſe Arguments that have prevailed with me to Dedicate this Book to all ſorts, ranks and degrees of perſons, rather then to any ſingle perſon, or to any one ſort or rank of men whatſoever: And they are theſe ſix,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe all ſorts and ranks of men are faln <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> from that Primitive holineſs that once they had:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſalm 14.3. Rom. 3.12.</hi> Qui te non habet Domine Deus, totum perdidit. <hi>Bernard.</hi>
               </note> There are five things that we have all loſt by our fall in <hi>Adam.</hi> Firſt, we have all loſt that holy image that God had ſtampt upon us, and ſo we are become vile. Secondly, we have all loſt our Son-ſhip, and ſo we are become ſlaves. Thirdly, we have all loſt our friendſhip with God, and ſo we are become enemies. Fourthly, we have all loſt our communion with God, and ſo we are become ſtrangers. And fifthly, we have all loſt our glory, and ſo we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come miſerable. Some ſay that the naked body of man was ſo glorious in his eſtate of Innocency, that all the beaſts of the field admired it, and thereupon did homage to him. O how glorious was his ſoul then! Certainly if the Cabinet was ſo glorious, the Jewel within it was much more glorious; But how glorious ſoever man was in his primitive eſtate, it is moſt certain that he is now ſo ſadly faln from the higheſt pinacle of glory, to ſo low a ſtep of miſery, that God ſometimes ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ds him to the Piſmire to learn inſtruction;<note place="margin">Prov. 6.6, 7.</note> and ſometimes he ſends him to the Stork and the Swallow to make a right improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of precious time;<note place="margin">Jer. 8.7.</note> and ſometimes he ſends him to the Ox and to the Aſs to learn knowledge;<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.3.</note> and ſometimes he ſends him to the Fowls of the air to learn confidence; yea and ſometimes he ſends him to the very Lillies and Graſs of the field,<note place="margin">Matth. 6.25, <hi>ult.</hi>
               </note> to learn how to live without carking and diſtracting cares. It is true, mans firſt eſtate was a ſtate of perfect holineſs,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.27.</note> he being made in the image of
<pb facs="tcp:104351:4"/> God, and after the likeneſs of God. It was an eſtate of perfect light,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.20.</note> knowledge, prudence, wiſdom and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; It was an eſtate of very great honour and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and therefore the Pſalmiſt (ſpeaking of man in this eſtate) brings him in with a Crown of glory and honour upon his head.<note place="margin">Pſalm 8.5.</note> 
               <hi>Thou haſt crowned him with glory and honour.</hi> Mans firſt eſtate was ſo ſtately an eſtate, that he was not ſo much below the glorious Angels, as he was above all other creatures. God made him the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord of the whole Creation,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.26. Pſalm 8.6, 7, 8.</note> God gave him an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Dominion and Authority both of Sea and Land, and all creatures in both were ſubjected to him. Such was the exquiſite beauty and perfection of his body, that from the crown of his head to the ſoles of his feet, there was not the leaſt blain or blemiſh; his outward man was cloathed with all ſuch requiſite beauties and abilities that might render him lovely and comely to every eye. In a word, mans firſt eſtate was a ſtate of perfect happineſs, all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, and all without him, and all about him, ſpoke him out to be compleatly bleſſed; there was nothing within him, but what was very ſweet and deſirable; there was nothing without him, but what was very delightful and amiable; neither was there any thing about him, but what was ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable and comfortable.<note place="margin">Lam. 5.16.</note> O but now by his fall, his crown is faln from his head, and from the heads of all his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; for <hi>Adam</hi> was a publick perſon, he was the Prince of all mankind; and though all mankind was not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in his loyns when he fell, yet they were all potentially in his loyns when he fell. If two Kings make a league, and the one break it, he makes not only himſelf but all his Subjects lyable and obnoxious to all the calamities and miſeries that ſhall follow thereupon. <hi>Adam</hi> was our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Father, and we are all his Sons and Daughters:
<pb facs="tcp:104351:4"/> Now we know by the Law of inheritance, that if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forfeit his Leaſe, he diſ-inherits his poſterity. Now <hi>Adam</hi> forfeited his Leaſe (as I may ſay) and divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice took the advantage of the forfeiture, and ſo hath turned all his poſterity out of doors. So that there is now no way under heaven to be happy, but by being holy; all ſorts and ranks of men are faln in <hi>Adam,</hi> and there is no way to riſe but by Chriſt and holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond Reaſon why I dedicate this Treatiſe to all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſorts and ranks of perſons, is, becauſe the matter contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this book, is of the greateſt and higheſt concernment imaginable, to all ranks and degrees of men, from the greateſt Emperour that ever ſet upon a Throne, to the meaneſt and the pooreſt wretch that ever lay upon a Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill: And doubtleſs that which is of ſuch a marvellous importance to all, may very juſtly and reaſonably be dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to all.</p>
            <p>A third reaſon why I dedicate this Treatiſe to all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſorts and ranks of perſons, is, becauſe God intends to ſave ſome of all ſorts, ranks and degrees; though greatneſs and goodneſs do not alwayes meet, yet greatneſs and goodneſs do ſometimes meet; and though riches and religion do not alwayes meet, yet riches and religion do ſometimes meet; though not many wiſe, yet ſome wiſe;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.26.</note> though not many mighty, yet ſome mighty; though not many noble, yet ſome noble, ſhall be called, ſanctified and ſaved. Look as the Sun in the Firmament doth caſt his light and warmth upon all ſorts, ranks and degrees of men:<note place="margin">Matth. 5.45.</note> So doth the Sun of righteouſneſs ſhine upon the underſtandings and conſciences of all ſorts, ranks and degrees of men, and by his ſecret and ſpiritual influences, he warms and cheers the hearts of high and low, rich and poor, noble and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble. <hi>Abraham</hi> was very great and very gracious:

            <p>A fifth Reaſon why I thus Dedicate this Treatiſe as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> you ſee, is, becauſe though all men are bound to be holy, yet the great, the rich, the noble, and the honourable of the earth, are bound above all other men in the world to be holy.<note place="margin">Reader if thou art one that ſtandeſt upon thy birth, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and greatneſs, do thy ſelf that favour, and thy ſoul that right, as to read from page 343. to page 447. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou goeſt any further.</note> God hath laid upon them greater obligations and Tyes to holineſſe, then he hath upon any other men under heaven; and this you may ſee ſo clearly and ſo fully proved in this Book, (from page <hi>433.</hi> to page <hi>447.</hi>) that neither the world nor the Devil, as cunning and as learned a Devil as he is, will ever be able to diſprove.

               </gap>, as can hardly be imagined, as can rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be declared. The Poet in the (Greek) Epigram taught the ſilver Ax of juſtice that was carried before the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Magiſtrate to proclaim, If thou be an offendor, let not the ſilver flatter thee: if an innocent, let not the Ax affright thee. The Athenian Judges judged in the night, when the faces of men could not be ſeen, that ſo they might be impartial in judgement. I have read of <hi>Zaleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> that impartial Law-giver and Judge among the <hi>Locrians,</hi> how that he made a very ſevere Law againſt Adulterers: <hi>viz.</hi> That whoſoever ſhould be found guilty thereof, ſhould have both their eyes put out; Now it ſo fell out, that his Son proved the firſt offendor: forthwith ſentence was pronounced, and execution ready to be done, whereupon the people earneſtly intreated the Judge his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he would pardon the fact, who upon ſerious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, put out one of his own eyes, and one of his ſons, and ſo ſhewed himſelf to be both a tender Father, and an upright and impartial Judge at once. O Sirs, it is your wiſdom and work, yea it is as much your glory as it is your duty, to be impartial in all your adminiſtrations of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and not to favour friends or relations, nor to fear the frowns of enemies, but to proceed impartially accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the merits of the Cauſe that is before you. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, As you muſt do juſtice impartially, ſo you muſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> do juſtice ſpeedily. <hi>Jer. 28.12. O houſe of</hi> David, <hi>thus ſaith the Lord, execute judgement in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and deliver him that is ſpoyled out of the hand
<pb facs="tcp:104351:9"/> of the oppreſſor, leſt my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it, becauſe of the evil of your doings.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezra 7.16.</note> After examination, execution is to be done with expedition: When men cry out for juſtice, juſtice, you muſt not cry out <hi>Cras, Cras,</hi> to morrow, to morrrw; you muſt do juſtice in the morning; Noon juſtice and evening juſtice is not ſo acceptable to God, nor ſo honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your ſelves, nor ſo advantagious to others, as morning juſtice is. You are called Gods: and as in other things,<note place="margin">Ioel 3.4. Gen. 19. Num. 16. Pſalm 101.8. The Perſian King had one about him, whoſe office it was to mind him every morning of his cha ge, ſaying, Ariſe O King, and have an eye to thoſe affairs for which the great God hath made you King, and diſpatch them.</note> ſo in this, you ſhould be like to God, who is ſpeedy and ſwift in the exerciſe of Juſtice, as you may ſee by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Scriptures in the margin together. To delay juſtice, is worſe ſometimes then to deny juſtice; it is an evil thing and a dangerous thing, when Magiſtrates, Judges and Juſtices, are as long a bringing forth their Verdicts, as the Elephant her young. Delayes of juſtice makes many more irreconcileable: It makes the Clyent often go with an heavy heart, an empty purſe, and a thred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare coat: It fetcheth heavy ſighs and groans from the hearts, and a Sea of tears from the eyes of the delayed and oppreſſed. Magiſtrates, Judges, and Juſtices, ſhould be alwayes ready to do juſtice: they ſhould be alwayes at leiſure to do juſtice. I have read of one of the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> how that he would many times alight off from his horſe to do juſtice only to a poor body. It were well if all Judges and Juſtices would write after this Copy, to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do juſtice and judgement at all times, and upon all occaſions. O Sirs, you may have time to live, even when you have out-lived your ſeaſons and opportunities of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtice and judgement; and what a hell will then your lives be to you? To prevent this hell, it is good to do ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in the morning. I have read of a very poor woman, who was very earneſt with King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:104351:9"/> do her Juſtice, but he deferred her,<note place="margin">Plutarch. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegm. in vita Dometrii.</note> and told her that he had no leiſure to hear her: ſhe replyed then, Why have you leiſure to be King? The poor woman thought that they were very unmeet to be Kings and Judges, who could not be at leiſure to do juſtice, when the neceſsities and miſeries of poor creatures cryed aloud for Juſtice, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. I have read of a famouus paſſage of <hi>Theodorick</hi> King of the Romans, who when a widow came to him with a ſad complaint,<note place="margin">The Poets feign Juſtice to be the daughter of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> whom he hath ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the world to revenge thoſe injuries that one man doth to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Here was Royal Juſtice indeed. O that all the Magiſtrates, Judges, and Juſtices of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would every morning lay <hi>Prov. 13.12.</hi> warm up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their hearts. <hi>Hope deferred maketh the heart ſick: but when the deſire cometh, it is a tree of life.</hi> The Hebrew word <hi>Memuſhſhacah,</hi> that is here rendred <hi>deferred,</hi> is from <hi>Maſhach,</hi> that ſignifies to draw out at length: men are ſhort-breathed, and ſhort-ſpirited, and hopes hours are full of eternity: and when their hopes are drawn out at length, this makes their hearts ſick; and ah what a world of ſuch ſick ſouls lies languiſhing at Hopes Hoſpital all the Nation over, yea
<pb facs="tcp:104351:10"/> all the world over. Hope in this Text is put for the good things men hope for; now when the good things men hope for (be it juſtice or a quick diſpatch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) are deferred and delayed, this makes the poor Client ſick at heart. A ling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hope alwayes breeds in the heart a lingring conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. The harder travel hope hath, and the more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it labours to bring forth, and yet is deferred and delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the more deadly ſick the Client grows. But when the deſire cometh, that is, when the thing deſired, wiſhed and looked for, be it juſtice, be it righteouſneſſe, be it ſucceſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is gained, it is a Tree of life; or rather as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew hath it, is a Tree <hi>(Chajim)</hi> of lives. All ſorts of lives, and all the comforts and contents of life, are wrapt up in the enjoyment of the thing deſired. He that hath theſe things granted to him, that are earneſtly deſired by him, is once more put into a Paradiſe. Wilful delayes in juſtice, makes the Iudge unrighteous, <hi>Luke 18.6.</hi> But,</p>

<pb facs="tcp:104351:10"/> not hypocritically juſt, but intirely juſt; not partially juſt, but univerſally juſt; not juſt to ſome, but juſt to all; not tranſiently juſt, but perpetually juſt; not ſometimes juſt, but alwayes juſt; and ſo much the Geminating of the word <hi>Juſtice, Juſtice,</hi> imports. <hi>Prov. 21.15. It is joy to the juſt to do judgement.</hi> This argues much ſincerity and integrity in a mans ſpirit, when he doth not only do judgment, but joyes to do judgement; it is a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to do juſtice ſlightly, lightly, wantonly; but it is an honour to do juſtice from a principle of divine joy; he that joyes to do judgement, he will do juſtice ſincerly, he will do juſtice out of love to juſtice; and indeed there are no Judges, there are no Juſtices to thoſe that do juſtice out of love to juſtice. <hi>Mazarinus</hi> complaineth of Forraign Judges, that they too much reſembled the blood-ſtone, which hath a ſpecial property to ſtanch blood, but as Jewellers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, it puts not forth this vertue, unleſs it be let in or covered over with ſilver, and ſo applyed to the vein: but certainly theſe men were far from doing juſtice ſincerely, from doing juſtice out of love to juſtice. Some Judges and Juſtices there have been, who for the cleanlineſſe of the conveyance, would like Mendicant Fryars, touch no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney themſelves, but have a boy or a Clerk with a bag to receive it for them: Certainly theſe were as far from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtice out of love to juſtice, as heaven is from hell, or as the Pope, the Turk and the Devil, are from being real Saints. Doubtleſſe many Magiſtrates, Judges, and Juſtices have found that a gift blindeth the wiſe,<note place="margin">Exod. 23.8.</note> and perverteth the words of the righteous. Golden duſt hath put out more eyes then it hath done good to hearts. O this golden-wedge, this ſilver ſquinſie hath made many men ſilent and ſpeechleſſe in good cauſes. <hi>Titus Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> was ſo delighted in doing of juſtice, that if a day

And ſo <hi>Epaminondas</hi> a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, though he was very poor, and often tempted with great bribes and preſents to be unjuſt, yet he refuſed and ſcorned all, and would commonly ſay, that if the cauſe were good, he would do it without a bribe, becauſe it was good; but if the cauſe was bad, he would not meddle with it for a world. Theſe Heathens will one day riſe in judgement againſt all ſuch corrupt Judges and Juſtices, that will not do juſtice without a bribe. If this Treatiſe ſhould fall into the hands of any ſuch, I would then let them know, that God will one day make good that dreadful word againſt them, that you have in <hi>Job 15.34. For the Congregation of hypocrites ſhall be deſolate, and fire ſhall conſume the Tabernacles of bribery;</hi> Or as the Septuagint reads it, of men that take gifts fire ſhall conſume: or rather as the Hebrew hath it, Fire ſhall eat the Tabernacles, it ſhall feed on their Tabernacles as gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily as a hungry man doth feed on his meat. O, the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous buildings and brave ſtructures that have been built by the hands of bribery, ſhall be ſet on fire by a hand of juſtice.<note place="margin">Prov. 10.2, 3. and chap. 3.33.</note> If bribery brings in a thouſand one year, Divine juſtice will caſt away two for it the next year. God will one day burn up on both hands, all the comforts, and all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, and all the enjoyments of corrupt Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, Judges, and Juſtices. I have read of a Polonian Judge, that ſtood up very ſtoutly and reſolutely a long time for a poor Plaintiff againſt a rich Defendant: but at laſt he received from the Defendant a great ſumme of money, ſtamped with the uſual ſtamp of that Countrey, which is a man in compleat armour; and at the next Seſsion in open Court, he adjudged the Cauſe in the favour of the

If Princes did but exerciſe ſuch Royal juſtice upon all corrupt covetous Judges and Juſtices, juſtice would be had at a cheaper rate, and poor men would not be ſo often put to pawn their Coats, nor rich men would not ſo often empty their Purſes, nor mortgage their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As you muſt do juſtice ſincerly, ſo you muſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> do juſtice deliberately: you muſt have one ear for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, and another for the Plaintiff,<note place="margin">Deut 17.4.</note> or elſe you will tell the world at once, that you are both weak and wicked. <hi>Deut. 19.17, 18, 19. vide.</hi> It argues much weakneſs and emptineſs of ſpirit, to judge a matter before all is
<pb facs="tcp:104351:12"/> heard that can be ſaid.<note place="margin">Job 29.16.</note> 
               <hi>Jobs</hi> piety and prudence ſhined forth eminently in this, that the Cauſe that he knew not, he ſearched it out. Before God would pronounce judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon <hi>Adam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> he firſt examins him, and propounds ſeveral interrogatories to him: And in thoſe two great and famous acts of juſtice, when God confounded <hi>Babels</hi> builders,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. and chap. 18.</note> and rained hell out of heaven upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorah,</hi> he tells you that he will go down and ſee. You are called gods; in this it is as much your glory as it is your duty, to imitate the great God. Though <hi>Solomon</hi> was in all his glory, yet he had patience to hear both what the mother and the harlot had to ſay. The Holy-Ghoſt puts the fool upon him that anſwers a matter before he hears it, <hi>Prov. 18.13.</hi> It was the uſual cuſtom of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> to ſtep one of his ears whileſt the accuſer was ſpeaking, that ſo he might reſerve it for the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. I have read of ſome who have deeply ſuffered both in their civil liberties, and in their conſciences, for their raſh and haſty paſsing of judgement upon others. Why hath God given the Judges of the earth two ears, and but one tongue, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt quite contrary. Certainly all acts of juſtice ought to flow from mature deliberation: All Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, Judges, and Juſtices, in their adminiſtrations of juſtice and judgement, ſhould wiſely obſerve by what principles they act, and by what Rules they act, and by what Authority they act, and in what manner they act, and to what ends they act: and how all theſe important
<pb facs="tcp:104351:12"/> things can be done without ſerious deliberation, I cannot for the preſent underſtand. Juſtice in the Emblem is repreſented with a Ballance in the one hand, and a Sword in the other, to note that matters muſt be firſt delib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>b.</hi> The Civil Law concludes it very unreaſonable for any man to give Advice or Judgement before he hath conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and weighed the whole Cauſe.<note place="margin">Civile dig. <hi>4.</hi> de legis ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſque conſul.</note> And therefore by your own Laws you are bound to deliberate before you give Judgement: Unleſſe you will tell the world, that you, even you, are unreaſonable men, who above all others ſhould be the Maſters of the greateſt reaſon as well as men of the greateſt meaſures of grace and holineſſe. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, As you muſt do Juſtice deliberately, ſo you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> muſt do Juſtice reſolutely, couragiouſly, valiantly. As ſoon as <hi>Joſhua</hi> came into the office of Magiſtracy, God charges him no leſſe then three times (in a breath as it were) to be very couragious, in <hi>Joſhua 1.6, 7, 9.</hi> A Judge that is timerous, will quickly be treacherous: A Judge that is fearfull, can never be faithful. <hi>Solomons</hi> Throne was ſupported with Lyons, to ſhew that Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ſhould be men of courage and mettal. The <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Judges ſate in <hi>Mars</hi> ſtreet,<note place="margin">Acts 17.22. Job 31, 31, 34.</note> to ſhew that they had Martial hearts, and that they were men of courage and mettal. <hi>Job</hi> was a Judge of rare courage and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity; nothing could fear him, nothing could daunt him, nothing could terrifie him, nothing could diſcourage him from doing Juſtice and Judgement. The <hi>Graeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> placed Juſtice betwixt <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Libra</hi> to ſignifie that as there muſt be indifferency in determining, ſo there
<pb facs="tcp:104351:13"/> ought to be courage in executing. Where there is cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage without knowledge, there the eye of Juſtice is blind; and where there is knowledge without courage, there the ſword of Juſtice is blunt. Judges and Juſtices ſhould be men of courage for God and godlineſſe: Why ſhould not the ſtandard be of ſteel, and the chief poſts in the houſe be heart of Oak? I have read of <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> how that he was by all concluded fit to be made their King, but that he halted. Men of the beſt &amp; choiceſt accompliſhments, if they are not couragious and magnanimous, but lame and halting, they are no wayes fit for Magiſtrates. Judges and Juſtices ſhould have Martial Spirits, high Spirits for Juſtice and Righteouſneſſe. Every Judge, every Juſtice ſhould have a Lyons heart, an Eagles eye, and a Gyants arm. Such men whoſe hearts are faint, whoſe heads are dull, whoſe ears are heavy, whoſe eyes are dim, whoſe hands are weak, and whoſe feet are lame, are more fit to ſit in a Chimney corner, then to ſit Judges and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon the Bench. It hath been long ſince ſaid of <hi>Cato, Fabritius,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> that it was as eaſie to remove the Sun out of the Firmament, as to remove them from Juſtice and Equity, they were men of ſuch couragious and magnanimous Spirits for Juſtice and Righteouſneſſe, No ſcarlet Robe doth ſo well become a Judge, as holy courage and ſtoutneſſe doth. I have read of <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh King of <hi>France,</hi> who going about to eſtabliſh ſome unjuſt Edicts, which when ſome of his chief Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers perceived, they went altogether to him in Red-Gowns: the King asked them what they would have: the Preſident <hi>La Vacqueri</hi> anſwered, We are come with a full purpoſe to loſe our lives every one of us, rather then by our connivency any unjuſt Ordinance ſhould take place: The King being amazed at this Anſwer, and at the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
<pb facs="tcp:104351:13"/> conſtancy and reſolution of thoſe Peers, gave them gracious entertainment, and commanded, that all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Edicts ſhould be forthwith cancelled in his preſence. Courage and reſolution may prevent many a Publick miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and miſery. But,</p>
            <p>Sixthly, As you are to do Juſtice reſolutely, couragiouſly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> ſo you are to do Juſtice and Judgement exactly.<note place="margin">Exod. 23.6, 7.13. The Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table practiſe, when their Judges were ſet, they cauſed the Image of a divine Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by them called truth, to be hung about his neck, who ſate next unto the Judges, to make them the more exact and heedfull in Iudgement.</note> 
               <hi>2</hi> Chro. <hi>19.5, 6, 7. And he ſet Judges in the Land, throughout all the fenced Cities of</hi> Judah, <hi>City by City. And ſaid to the Judges, Take heed what you do, for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the Judgement. Wherefore now, let the fear of the Lord be upon you; Take heed and do it, for there is no ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity with the Lord our God, nor reſpect of perſon, nor taking of gifts.</hi> God is exact in all his wayes, and he is exact in all his works: he is exact in all his promiſes, &amp; he is exact in all his threatnings: he is exact in all his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and he is exact in all his puniſhments; he is exact in the exerciſe of his mercy, and he is exact in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his Juſtice: And therefore you that are called Gods, ſhould in this be like God. O Sirs, ſome by force, others by flattery; ſome by large preſents to your relations, and others by promiſing great rewards to your ſelves may indeavour to corrupt you, and blind you, and induce you to judge raſhly, inconſiderately, irregularly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore you have the more cauſe to be exact in tranſacting all your judicial affairs. O remember, that the moſt ſharp &amp; pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eye of God is ſtill upon you! O remember, that the ſevere eye of Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Judge of Judges, is never off of you; And the Angels thoſe Princes of glory, are very ſtrict Obſervers of you. When the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Judges were ſet in their ſeats of Judicature, certain empty chairs were placed about them, into which they conjectured the holy
<pb facs="tcp:104351:14"/> Angels came and were ſpectators of all their tranſactions; and this they thought would work ſuch an awe, ſuch a dread, ſuch a care, ſuch a fear, and ſuch a reſolution in them that they could not but manage all their Judicial proceedings with much exactneſſe and heedfulneſſe. And as the Angels have their eyes upon you, ſo Satan hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes his eyes upon you,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cave, ſpectat Cato,</hi> was a watch-word among the Romans. O how much more ſhould <hi>Cave, ſpectat Dominus,</hi> be a watch-word amongſt you!</note> he hath alwayes a watchfull eye, an envious eye, a malitious eye, a crafty eye, and a reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eye upon you; witneſſe his diſſwading you ſometimes from your duty, and witneſſe his diſtracting and diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of you whileſt you are in your duty; and witneſſe his accuſing of you for the neglect of your duty; and witneſſe his endeavours to pride you, and puffe you up upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of your duty. And as the eye of Satan is upon you, ſo the eyes of good men are upon you, and the eyes of bad men are upon you: And if all this doth not beſpeak you to be very exact and accurate in all your Judicial tranſactions, I know nothing. My Lords and Gentlemen, if all this will not do, then remember that the lives, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, conſciences, rights, priviledges, eſtates and intereſts of perſons (next to God, and Chriſt, and Grace) are the moſt choice and precious, the moſt deſireable and delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Jewels that men have in all the world, and therefore you had need be very exact and accurate in all your Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial tranſactions. Yea once more, remember that God will one day bring you to an exact account concerning all your Judicial proceedings: That ſame mouth that tells you that you are Gods,<note place="margin">Pſalm 82.6. Heb. 9.27.</note> tells you alſo, that you muſt die like men: And after death comes Judgement. You that now call others to Judgement, ſhall ſhortly be called to Judgement your ſelves:<note place="margin">Acts 17.32.</note> you that now ſit in Judgement upon others, ſhall ere long be Judged by him that will Judge the world in righttouſneſs. My Lords and
<pb facs="tcp:104351:14"/> Gentlemen, give me leave to tell you,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tennes</hi> the ſon of <hi>Cyrnus,</hi> (who was worſhipped as a god) was ſo ſtrict and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he cauſed an Ax to be held over the witneſſes heads, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them out of hand, if they were taken with falſhood; and from thence was the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Tenedia bipennis.</hi>
               </note> that that Judge to whom you muſt be reſponſible, is no ignorant Judge, nor no covetous Judge, nor no partial Judge, nor no fearful Judge, nor no doating Judge, nor no trifling Judge, though ſuch there may be in the world; but he is an omniſcient Judge, an omnipotent Judge, an impartial Judge, a holy Judge, a couragious Judge, a ſerious Judge, a ſevere Judge, an unbiaſſed Judge, a righteous Iudge, and a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Iudge. Alas Sirs, it is not your ſcarlet Gowns, nor your Titles of honour, nor your great eſtates, nor your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Princes, nor your noble relations, nor your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe among men, that will ſtand you in ſtead when you ſhall ſtand before that Iudge that is a conſuming fire, <hi>Heb. 12. ult.</hi> Well Gentlemen, remember this, there is never a profeſsing Iudge nor Iuſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But,</p>
            <p>Seventhly, As you muſt do juſtice and judgement ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> ſo you muſt do juſtice to others, as you would have others do juſtice to you. For Judges and Juſtices to do as they would be done by, is the Royal Law, the golden Rule, and the Standard of equity. Judges and Juſtices ſhould think of others, as they would have others think of them; and ſpeak of others, as they would have others ſpeak of them; and do to others, as they would have others do to
<pb facs="tcp:104351:15"/> them.<note place="margin">Mat. 7.12. <hi>Severus</hi> the Emperour had this Scripture often in his mouth; and whenſoever he puniſhed any of his ſouldiers for offering of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he ſtill commanded this Scripture to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by the Cryer.</note> Whatever by the light of nature, or by the light of conſcience, or by the light of Scripture, a Judge, a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, would have another do to him, the ſame muſt he do to another. In all juſt things (for ſo this Law of Chriſt is only to be underſtood) we muſt do to others, as we would have others do to us; as we would have others carry it equally, juſtly and righteouſly towards us, ſo we muſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it equally, juſtly, and righteouſly towards others: and as we would not have others to wrong us in our names, eſtates, rights, liberties, lives, ſo we muſt not wrong others in their names, eſtates, rights, liberties, lives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Law of Chriſt is the ſumme of all righteouſneſſe; it is the foundation of all Juſtice and Equity. Self-love doth ſo commonly blind the ſons of men, that to judge righteouſly, they muſt change the perſon, they muſt put themſelves in others room.

Well, my Lords and Gentlemen, for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, All thoſe ſins that are in this Land com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, which by your juſt power and gracious examples might have been prevented, all thoſe ſins in the great day ſhall be charged upon your accounts; and therefore it highly concerns you with all your might to brow-beat wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, to diſcountenance ungodlineſſe, and to improve
<pb facs="tcp:104351:16"/> your power to the uttermoſt for the ſuppreſsing of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſſe, and for the countenancing, encouraging, and promoting of real holineſſe, that ſo you may give up your accounts at laſt with joy. I have read of King <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> how that by his godly example, and by his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing and encouraging ſuch as were godly, and by his diſcountenancing of prophaneſſe and wickedneſſe, he drew this whole Kingdom once to look after godlineſſe. Oh my Lords and Gentlemen, if you would be but ſhining ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and patterns of holineſſe to the Nation; if you would but in good earneſt put forth your utmoſt power for the encouraging of godlineſſe, and for the ſuppreſsing of prophaneſſe: O what a holy Nation, yea what a happy Nation ſhould we have! King <hi>Cyrus</hi> commanded the chief officers of his Army to keep a ſtrict hand upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for ſaith he, that is the beſt way in the world to keep the whole Army in good order: the application is eaſie. But,</p>
            <p>Eighthly, In the exerciſe of juſtice, you muſt look that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> juſtice and mercy, that juſtice and clemency go hand in hand. <hi>Prov. 20.28.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 29.14. Pſalm 101.1.</note> 
               <hi>Mercy and truth preſerve the King: and his Throne is upholden by mercy:</hi> Some read the words thus,<note place="margin">It is uſual in Scripture, by Truth, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</note> 
               <hi>Mercy and juſtice preſerve the King, and his Throne is upholden by mercy.</hi> All juſtice will not preſerve the King, nor all mercy will not preſerve the King; there muſt be a mixture both of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and mercy to preſerve the King, and to uphold his Throne; and to ſhew that mercy is more requiſite then ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, the word <hi>Mercy</hi> is doubled in the Text. Juſtice without Mercy turns into rigour, and ſo becomes hateful; Mercy without Juſtice turns into fond pity, and ſo becomes contemptible. Look as the rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> and the pot of <hi>Manna</hi> were by Gods command laid up in the ſame Ark,
<pb facs="tcp:104351:17"/> ſo muſt mercy and juſtice be preſerved intire in the boſom of the ſame Magiſtrate,<note place="margin">King <hi>John</hi> thought to ſtrengthen himſelf by gathering a great deal of money toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the exerciſe of mercy, cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and lenity, he loſt his peoples affections, and ſo after many endleſs tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyles, he came to an unhappy end.</note> Iudge, and Iuſtice. Mercy and juſtice, mildneſſe and righteouſneſſe, lenity and fidelity, are a ſafer and a ſtronger guard to Princes and People, then rich Mines, munitions of Rocks, mighty Armies, powerful Navies, or any warlike preparations. It is very obſervable that Chriſt is called but once the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> in the book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and that is in <hi>chap. 5.5.</hi> but he is called a Lamb no leſſe then nine and twenty times in that book: and what is this, but to ſhew the tranſcendent mercy, clemency, lenity, mild<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe and ſweetneſſe that is in Jeſus Chriſt, and to ſhew that he is infinitely more inclined to the exerciſe of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, then he is to the exerciſe of juſtice. It is true, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, Judges and Juſtices, ſhould be Lions in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſtice; and it is as true, that they ſhould be Lambs in the exerciſe of mercy and clemency, mildn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſſe and ſweetneſſe: And the more ready and inclinable they are to the exerciſe of mercy, where mercy is to be ſhewed, the more like to the Lamb they are. <hi>Seneca</hi> hath long ſince obſerved, that the cuſtom of anointing Kings, was to ſhew that Kings ſhould be above all other men of the greateſt ſweetneſſe and mildneſſe; their anointing being a ſign of that Kingly ſweetneſſe and mildneſſe that ſhould be in them. <hi>Nero</hi>'s ſpeech hath great praiſe, who when he was to ſubſcribe to the death of any condemned man, would ſay, <hi>Utinam neſcirem literas,</hi> I wiſh I did not know how to write. But,</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Ninthly and laſtly, you muſt do juſtice proportionable to the nature of the offence; your penalties and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt be alwayes ſuitable to the offence; to puniſh any fact more ſeverely then it deſerves, is alwayes inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to the offendour: for ſo far innocency it ſelf ſuffers,
<pb facs="tcp:104351:17"/> as any man is puniſhed beyond the demerit of his offence;<note place="margin">I have read of the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> that if it either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed or be de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fective in its due over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> it cauſeth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: the application is eaſie. <hi>Cleobulus,</hi> one of the ſeven Sages, was wont to ſay, that Medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity was without compare.</note> and to puniſh leſſe then the Fact deſerves, may be of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence to the publike. The Roman <hi>Faſces</hi> were a bundle of rods with an Ax in the midſt, to ſignifie the equity of Magiſtrates in puniſhing ſome only with reds, and others with the Ax; the Romans had their rods for leſſer faults, and their Ax for capital crimes. Juſtice is then remiſs, when it ſpares where it ought to puniſh; and Juſtice is then too ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>vere, when it puniſheth where it ought to ſpare. Extream right often proves extream wrong: he that will alwayes go to the utmoſt of what the Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, will too too often do more then the Law requires; it is rare, very rare, to ſee a man dance upon the brink of the pit, and not to tumble in: A rigid-ſeverity often mars all; equity is ſtill to be preferred before extremity. To inflict great penalties and heavy cenſures for light offences, this is to kill a Fly upon a mans fore-head with a Beetle. In the French Hiſtory, there is mention made of an old Courtier that would needs depart the Court, and retire himſelf to a private life; the King deſired him before he went, to leave his advice in ſome general Rules, what was beſt to be done in the Government of the Kingdom. Upon which motion, he took a fair paper, and wrote upon the top of the leaf, <hi>Moderation;</hi> and in the middle of the leaf, <hi>Moderation;</hi> and at the bottom of the leaf, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration;</hi> ſignifying thereby thus much to the King, that the beſt way in the world to have his Crown ſet faſt, and to keep his Kingdom ſafe, was to manage throughout all his affairs with moderation. And there is nothing more evident in Scripture and Hiſtory then this, that many by ſcruing the pegs of Government too high, have broke all in pieces about their ears.</p>
            <p>Now my Lords and Gentlemen, there are five things
<pb facs="tcp:104351:18"/> or Rules that will be of ſingular uſe to help you in this caſe, to ſteer ſuch a courſe as may be ſafe and honourable to you; and as may render you a mercy and a bleſsing to the Nation.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And the firſt is this, never make thoſe things to be ſins, which God never made to be ſins; to make thoſe things to be ſins, which God hath made to be no ſins, is to make gods of your ſelves; yea it is to lift up your ſelves above God himſelf, as if you were more holy, more wiſe, more juſt, and more righteous then the holy one of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is. Indeed the Papiſts, that are will-worſhippers, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly highly conceited of their own wiſdom and worth, they frequently tranſgreſſe this Rule with their <hi>Touch not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 2.21, 23.</note> 
               <hi>taſte not, handle not;</hi> which things have indeed a ſhew of wiſdom in will-worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but why ſhould you? why ſhould you? who have a higher profeſsion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and a more clear Goſpel-light ſhining every day more ſtrongly upon you. But,</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Never make thoſe things to be abſolute and neceſſary duties, that God hath nowhere declared to be ſuch.<note place="margin">Iſa. 33.22. Jam. 4.12.</note> Such things that do neither fall under a general nor a particular command of God, may not be impoſed upon the conſciences of men as abſolute and neceſſary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be performed by them; a faithful obſerving of theſe two Rules, would prevent a multitude of ſins, a ſea of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and a world of troubles. But,</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, In all your adminiſtrations of juſtice, take the Authority of the Word with you: this will yield you moſt comfort, moſt peace, moſt ſecurity, and moſt boldneſſe, in the great day of your account. But,</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Never put off your own ſouls with any ſuch pleas or arguments now, that are not pleadable in the Court of conſcience, when you ſhall lie upon your dying-beds;
<pb facs="tcp:104351:18"/> nor that are not pleadable before the Court of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when you ſhall ſtand before Chriſts Judgement-feat. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly and laſtly, In all your adminiſtrations of juſtice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and judgement, be ſure that you act nothing upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any command, commiſsion, or authority under heaven, that you dare not own, plead and ſtand by before the great authority of heaven, when the King of Kings ſhall make a narrow inſpection into all your Judicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and accordingly paſſe judgement upon you. What though this command, and that commiſsion, and the other authority may bear you out in this world, yet if they are too weak to bear you out in the other world, you will curſe the day that ever you were born, and wiſh that you had rather been a turning of ſpits, or lying under an hedge, or a begging at the rich mans door, then that you had ever ſate in ſeats of Judicature, to act upon ſuch grounds, as are no wayes pleadable before the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when he ſhall come in the glory of his father, with all his holy Angels, to judge all the Kings, Princes, Nobles, Judges and Juſtices of the earth. My Lords and Gentlemen, if theſe five things or Rules were but ſincerely, ſeriouſly, reſolutely, and conſtantly followed, no heart can conceive, nor no tongue can expreſſe the hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſins, the ſore troubles, and the dreadful calamities, and woful miſeries that thereby would be prevented. And thus my Lords and Gentlemen, I have done with thoſe ſpecial Rules that you are carefully, diligently, faithfully, and conſtantly to obſerve, in all your Judicial adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but how you will be able to act ſuitable and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to theſe Rules without a ſpirit of holineſſe, without a principle of holineſſe, and without an experiment of the powerful operations of holineſſe in your own ſouls, I am
<pb facs="tcp:104351:19"/> not able to ſee;<note place="margin">If you pleaſe to read from page 433. to page 447. you will find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more weighty ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to move you to labour after holineſs.</note> and therefore how much it ſtands you upon that want that holineſſe, that this Treatiſe holds forth, to ſtudy holineſſe, to love holineſſe, to prize holineſſe, to countenance holineſſe, to encourage holineſſe, to promote holineſſe, and to be reſtleſſe till you have experienced the power, and life, and ſweet of holineſſe in your own hearts and lives, I muſt leave you to Judge. And O that after all this pains that I have taken upon the account of your immortal ſouls, I may not have cauſe to complain, as once <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> did, <hi>Alas</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thoſe Graces which the Deity ſent down as ſo many pillars to ſtay up humane Societies,</hi> viz. <hi>Faith and Modeſty, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Verity, they found ſuch cold entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the world, that they are fled back to heaven.</hi> I ſhall follow theſe weak endeavours with my beſt prayers, that you may all put on holineſſe as a Royal Robe, and that all your Judicial adminiſtrations may ſavour of a ſpirit of holineſſe, and of the power and prevalency of holineſſe, that ſo you may be as high in happineſſe above others, as you are now in power and place exalted above others.</p>
            <p>If this Treatiſe ſhould fall into any of their hands who call and account themſelves the only Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt; I mean ſuch, who preach rather to pleaſe then to profit; to tickle the ear, then to awaken the conſcience; that are better at fleecing of their Flocks, then they are at feeding of their Flocks;<note place="margin">Ezek. 13. read it throughout.

Several Authors in Print have proved this to my hand at large, and therefore I ſhall not enlarge upon it; only give me leave to ſay, that Gods holy things ought to be handled with fear and reverence, rather then with wit and dalliance: Spiritual niceneſs is the next degree to

            <p>Gentlemen, by theſe ſhort hints you may ſee, as in a glaſſe, if you will not put a cheat upon your own ſouls, how unlike to the true, holy, and faithful Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt you are. O Sirs, do not you know that the holy Scriptures (that never ſpoke Treaſon nor Sedition) do clearly evidence, that an ignorant, prophane, ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, ſuperſtitious, inſufficient, and ſoul-flattering Clergy, are the greateſt Peſt, Plague, Affliction, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that can befall a people, as you may eaſily ſee by comparing theſe Scriptures together, <hi>Mich. 2.11. Iſa. 30.10, 11. Jer. 5.</hi> ult. <hi>Lam. 2.14. Iſa. 9.16. Ezek. 3.18. Jer. 23.9, 18. Ezek. 13.22. Jer. 6.14.</hi>

Other afflictions and judgements may ſpring from the fatherly love of God, and from a gracious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of good to his people. <hi>Rev. 3.19. Prov. 3.11. Heb. 12.5.6, 7, 8. Pſalm 89.30, 35. Job 7.17, 18.</hi> but this is a ſad fruit of Gods judicial Anger and ſevere Indignation againſt a people. Other judgements often iſſue in mens ſeeking of the Lord, and in mens returning to the Lord. <hi>Iſa. 26.16, 17. Hoſea 5.14, 15.</hi> compared with <hi>chap 6.1, 2, 3.</hi> and <hi>chap. 2.6, 7.</hi> but this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment frequently iſſues in mens forſaking of the Lord, and in their running from God, and in their walking contrary to God, and in the hardening of them againſt God, and in an everlaſting ſhutting of them out from the preſence of the Lord: as you may ſee by comparing of theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures together. <hi>Matth. 15.14. Luke 6.39. 1 Theſ. 5.3. 2 Theſ. 1.7, 8, 9, 10. Matth. 23.13.</hi> Do not you know that where there is no viſion, the people periſh? <hi>Prov. 29.18.

Others carry it thus, The people ſhall be diſcovered; it will then appear what is within, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grace or ſin; it will then be diſcovered, what pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, breathings, hungerings, and longings there be in ſouls after God, and Chriſt, and holineſſe, and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>&amp;c.

Others thus, The people ſhall be of no eſteem, of no repute, no body will prize them, no body will value them, no body will regard them; men ſet no price, no value upon naked perſons. Others thus, The people ſhall be diſperſed, ſcattered, ſhivered and ſhattered; and this in all Ages hath been too apparent. Others thus, They ſhall be drawn away with errours: they ſhall either be ſtarved, or elſe poyſoned with God-diſhonouring, Chriſt-denying, Scripture-debaſing, Conſcience-waſting, life-polluting, and ſoul-damning opinions; it is concluded on all hands, that it ſhall go ill, very ill, with that people that want vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that want ſerious, ſincere, faithful and powerful preaching; for where there is no viſion, no ſerious, ſincere, faithful and powerful preaching, there the people periſh certainly, undoubtedly, there they go tumbling to hell thick and three-fold; and this is evident in the Text, <hi>where there is no viſion, the people periſh;</hi> he doth
<pb facs="tcp:104351:22"/> not ſay they may periſh, but they do periſh: or they are in danger of periſhing, but they do certainly periſh. Where there is no ſerious, conſcientious, faithfull, powerfull preaching, there the people grow abominably wicked; as wofull experience tells us: And what the iſſue of that will be, you may ſee in <hi>Pſalm 9.17.

            <p>Where viſion fails, there men periſh temporally; when viſion, when preaching ceaſed among the Jews, O the dreadfull calamities and miſeries that came upon that people! how ſoon did God burn up all their outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, contentments and enjoyments on every hand, <hi>2 Chron. 15.3, 5, 6.</hi> compared with <hi>Ch. 13.9, 10, 11.</hi> and <hi>Chap. 36.15. — ult.

            <p>Where viſion fails, there men periſh totally:<note place="margin">Rom. 6.16.17, 19.</note> both the bodies and the ſouls of men periſh, where ſerious, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious preaching fails, <hi>Hoſ. 4.6.

            <p>Where viſion fails, there the people periſh inſenſibly and unexpectedly: they flatter themſelves that God is made up all of mercy, and will not believe but they ſhall go to heaven, till they awake with everlaſting flames about their ears, as you may ſee in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where viſion fails, there men periſh ſuddenly: In a moment they go down to hell, <hi>Job 21.13, 14, 15.</hi> As the travail of a woman comes ſuddenly upon her when ſhe leaſt expects it,<note place="margin">Prov. 24.22.

            <p>Where viſion fails, there men periſh inevitably, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably, <hi>1 Theſſ. 5.</hi> And they ſhall not eſcape, <hi>Prov. 6.15. Therefore ſhall his calamity come ſuddenly, ſuddenly ſhall he be broken without remedy.</hi> Here is their diſmial doom, they ſhall not be only bruiſed, but broken, yea, they ſhall be ſuddenly broken when they leaſt look for it, when they do not at all dream of it, or dread
<pb facs="tcp:104351:23"/> it; and this without remedy, they ſhall be ſo broken, as that there ſhall not be ſo much as a peſsibility of making them up again; if a man loſe his eſtate, his friend, his child, this l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>elingly, fervently, frequently, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and live as the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt ought to live, <hi>viz.</hi> heavenly, graciouſly, holly, humbly, righteouſly, harmleſly, and exemplarily, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or elſe lay down your very names of being the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, and put no longer a cheat upon your ſelves, nor upon the people, by making them believe that you are the only Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, when you have nothing of the Spirit of Chriſt, nor of the Anointings of Chriſt, nor of the Grace of Chriſt, nor of the life of Chriſt in you. Gentlemen, if this counſel be ſeriouſly minded and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully followed, it will turn more to your accounts in the great day of our Lord Jeſus, and do you more good then, then all the profits, preferments, and honours of this world can do you good now: But if you ſhall ſlight and deſpiſe this counſel now, I ſhall be found a true Prophet to your wo and miſery in that great day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this Treatiſe ſhould fall in the hands of any Ladies and Gentlewomen (as I ſuppoſe it may) that have not
<pb facs="tcp:104351:26"/> yet experienced the ſweet and powerful operations of holineſſe in their own ſouls, I would then ſay,</p>
            <p>Ladies and Gentlewomen, your ſouls are as precious, and as immortal, and as capable of union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt here, and of an eternal frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt hereafter, as the ſouls of any men in the world are. I have read a ſad ſtory of one <hi>Bochna,</hi> a woman which had but two ſons in all the world; and whilſt ſhe was walking with the one towards the River, ſhe heard the other crying out, and haſtening back, ſhe found a knife ſticking in his ſide, which killed him immediately: then ſhe made haſte to the other child, but he in her abſence was fain into the River and drowned, and ſo ſhe loſt both her ſons at once. Now Ladies, this is your very caſe; every one of you have two children (as I may ſay) a ſoul and a body, a life eternal, and a life temporal; and O what a dreadful and unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able loſſe would it be to loſe both theſe at once? and yet as certain as there is a God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, you will loſe them both without Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>All know, that know any thing of Scripture or Hiſtory, that there have been many great Ladies and Gentlewomen, that have been great lovers of holineſſe, and great delighters in holineſſe, and great prizers of holineſſe, and great admirers of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and great countenancers of holineſſe, and great encouragers of holineſſe, and great promoters of holineſſe, and great followers after holineſſe, and great experiencers of the ſweet and powerful opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of holineſſe in their own ſouls. And O that this might be all your honour and happineſſe, to be
<pb facs="tcp:104351:27"/> in all reſpects as famous for holineſſe, as any of your ſexe hath been before you.</p>
            <p>Chriſt hath prayed as much for your ſouls, as he hath for the ſouls of others; and he hath paid as much for your ſouls, as he hath for the ſouls of others; and he hath ſweat, and wept, and bled as much for your ſouls, as he hath for the ſouls of others; and he hath ſuffered, and ſatisfied as much for your ſouls, as he hath for the ſouls of others; and he hath purchaſed and prepared as great and as glorious things for your ſouls, as he hath for the ſouls of others, if you will be but a holy people to him; and what doth all this ſpeak out, but an unſpeakable readineſſe and willingneſſe in Jeſus Chriſt to ſanctifie you, and ſave you, as well as others?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A man might write volumes on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; there is ſo much ſaid in Scripture and Hiſtory upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; but in an Epiſtle a touch muſt ſuffice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>All knowing men can tell you, that many La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Gentlewomen in all Ages, have been very famous for all Natural, Moral, Spiritual and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired excellencies; yea more famous then many men that yet have done worthily in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and by their attainments you may eaſily ſee what is poſsible for you to attain unto, both in reſpect of gifts and grace. Of all things, graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous examples are moſt awakening, convincing and encouraging; for in them you may ſee that both the attainment of holineſſe, and the exerciſe of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is poſsible, though difficult; in eying of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, it is alwayes beſt to eye the higheſt, the holieſt and the worthieſt examples; for as he that ſhooteth at the Sun, though he falls ſhort of his mark, yet will ſhoot higher then he that aimeth only at a ſhrub; ſo thoſe that ſet up the higheſt examples of
<pb facs="tcp:104351:27"/> holineſſe for their mark, for their imitation, will certainly attain to greater degrees of holineſſe, then thoſe that propoſe to themſelves the meaneſt and the loweſt examples of holineſſe for their pattern and imitation.</p>
            <p>Well, Ladies and Gentlewomen, do you think that it is good going to hell,<note place="margin">Iſa. 33.14. 2 Theſ. 1.7, 8, 9, 10.</note> that it is good dwelling with the devouring fire, that it is good dwelling with everlaſting burnings, that it is good for ever to be ſeparated from the preſence of God, Chriſt, Angels, and the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect? that it is good for ever to lie a ſweltering under the wrath of an infinite juſt God, and to abide for ever and ever under thoſe pains and torments that are end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, eaſeleſſe, hopeleſſe and remedileſſe? and that it is good to be aſſociated, and fettered with Devils and damned ſpirits to all eternity? O no, this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be good; for the very ſerious thoughts of theſe things are enough even to raiſe a hell a this ſide hell in our hearts. O then, Ladies and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, pray that you may be holy; hear that you may be holy; read that you may be holy; and with all your might preſſe after holineſſe, and purſue hard after holineſſe, as after the one thing neceſſary; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holineſſe you will as certainly go to hell, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſons ſhall certainly go to heaven; and this you will find as clearly and fully proved in this following Treatiſe, as heart can wiſh.</p>
            <p>O that you would for ever remember this, that without all peradventure you ſhall never be ſaved, unleſſe you are ſanctified; you ſhall never be truly happy, unleſſe you are really holy: except God ſhould do five things that are not poſsible for him to do:
<pb facs="tcp:104351:28"/> 
               <hi>viz. 1.</hi> Change his purpoſe. <hi>2.</hi> Make null and void his decree. <hi>3.</hi> Make a new Goſpel. <hi>4.</hi> Find out a new way to heaven. And <hi>5.</hi> ungod himſelf. God muſt undo himſelf and ungod himſelf, if ever he make you happy before he hath made you holy: and therefore O what infinite cauſe have you to read this following Treatiſe, and to ſtudy this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, and to meditate on this Treatiſe, and to pray over this Treatiſe, and to look up to heaven for counſel and ſtrength to make ſuch an improvement of the means, helps, and directions that are here preſcribed for the attaining of holineſſe, as that you may be made really holy, that ſo you may be everlaſtingly happy! And to quicken and encourage your hearts in this work, I could heartily wiſh, that as ſoon as you have read over the Epiſtle, you would read from page <hi>433.</hi> to page <hi>447.</hi> for there you will finde many Arguments that are of a particular concernment to your ſelves, and that ought to be no ſmall obligations upon you to work you to purſue after holineſſe with all your might, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this Treatiſe ſhould fall into the hands of any faithful, ſerious, gracious, conſcientious, labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Miniſters hands, (as I ſuppoſe it may) I would then ſay, Reverend Sirs, let my weak en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours be a ſpur, a provocation to you to lay out your choiceſt and your chiefeſt gifts, parts, ſtrength, time and opportunities to promote holineſſe of life, and holineſſe in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and in all your ſacred Communions. Certainly, had we all eyed holineſſe more, and preached holineſſe more, and practiſed holineſſe more, and cryed up
<pb facs="tcp:104351:28"/> holineſſe more, and encouraged holineſſe more, and countenanced holineſſe more, the countenance both of God and man might have been ſet more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly towards us, then they are this day. When once maintenance comes to be more in Miniſters eyes then holineſſe; and when their ſtudies and endeavours are more to make men Proſelytes to this or that way, this or that form, this or that party, then to make men holy, it is no wonder if God writes out bitter things againſt them. I doubt not but providential diſpenſations have bad ſuch a teaching vertue in them, as to lead you to lay your fingers upon ſeveral ſuch like ſores, and to mourn over them, and to juſtifie the holy One of <hi>Iſrael</hi> who is holy in all his wayes, and righteous in all his works.</p>
            <p>Truly Brethren, I have alwayes lookt upon the great work of the Miniſtry to lie in two things; Firſt in making unholy men holy: and ſecondly in making them that are already holy, to be more and more holy. Firſt to beget holineſſe, and then to nurſe up holineſſe; firſt to bring ſouls to Chriſt, and then to build up ſouls in Chriſt, is without all peradventure the work of works that ſhould be moſt in every Miniſters eye, and that ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes lie neareſt and warmeſt upon every Miniſters heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And through grace I have reade this my grand deſign in the courſe of my Miniſtry, and throughout all my writings; and now it yields me that joy, that comfort, that content, and that ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, that I would not be without for all the world. Beſides, I know it will turn moſt to my account at the great day. O that all of you that yet
<pb facs="tcp:104351:29"/> have any opportunities and advantages in your hands to preach the everlaſting Goſpel, would make this your great buſineſſe to promote holineſſe, and to exalt and lift up holineſſe in the world: For as this great principle of holineſſe ſhall gain ground upon the hearts, conſciences and lives of men; ſo all the things of Antichriſt, and all the Trade of Antichriſt, and all thoſe grand miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs and miſeries that threaten the ſons of men, will fall before it, as <hi>Dagon</hi> fell before the Ark.</p>
            <p>If this Treatiſe ſhould fall into the hands of any of Gods ſanctified ones, of what degree or rank ſoever they are of, as I ſuppoſe it may fall into the hands of many ſuch, I would then ſay, Dear friends, In this Treatiſe you will find many ſtrong Motives to provoke you to perfect holineſſe in the fear of the Lord, and many ſpecial Means to enable you to perfect holineſſe in the fear of the Lord, and many evidences whereby you may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and infallibly know whether you have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to any conſiderable highth of holineſſe, or no; and in the opening of theſe things, you will find that great Doctrine about degrees of Glory in Heaven to be Aſſerted and Proved, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt it to be fairly diſmiſſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reader, If thou art one that to this very day art in an unſanctified eſtate, and an enemy to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or a ſcoffer at holineſſe, or a a ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſer of holineſſe, or a deſperate oppoſer of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or a bitter perſecutor of holineſſe, then I would commend this following Treatiſe (before any
<pb facs="tcp:104351:29"/> I know extant in the world) to the ſervice of thy ſoul, for I know none that is ſo calculated and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up for that purpoſe as this is. Read and judge. This I will aſſure thee, O thou unſanctified ſoul, that the grand deſign of this book is thy ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it is to make thee really holy, that thou mayeſt be eternally happy; and of this thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt be confident, <hi>viz.</hi> that I ſhall follow theſe poor labours with my earneſt prayers that they may be bleſſed to the internal and eternal welfare of thy ſoul, and that they may iſſue in the conviction, converſion, and ſalvation of thy ſoul. I ſhall ſend this Treatiſe forth into the world with <hi>Jacobs</hi> bleſsing and prayer for his ſons,<note place="margin">Gen. 43.14.</note> 
               <hi>God Almighty ſend thee mercy in the ſight of the man,</hi> &amp;c. in the ſight of the proud man that he may be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and in the ſight of the hardened man that he may be ſoftened, and in the ſight of the carnal man that he may be ſpiritualized, and in the ſight of the polluted man that he may be waſhed, and in the ſight of the unſanctified man that he may be ſanctified, and in the ſight of the ignorant man that he may be enlightened, and in the ſight of the ſtubborn man that he may be bowed, and in the ſight of the unconverted man that he may be changed, and in the ſight of the loſt man that he may be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian Reader, I ſuppoſe by this time that I have almoſt tired thee in reading, as I have my ſelf in writing, and therefore I ſhall preſently draw to a cloſe; only before I take my leave of thee,
<pb facs="tcp:104351:30"/> give me leave to ſay, that I am much of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagena's</hi> his mind, who to thoſe three things which the Antients held impoſsible, ſaith, that to find a Book Printed without <hi>Errata's,</hi> ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly have been added as a fourth impoſsible, if the Art of Printing had been then invented, though the Author had <hi>Briareus</hi> his hands, and the Printer <hi>Argus</hi> his eyes. Notwithſtanding all the care that hath been taken, thou wilt find figures miſplaced, and ſome miſpointings, with ſome other miſtakes of the Printer: I hope the ingenuous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will caſt a mantle of love over the miſtakes of the preſſe, and do me that right and himſelf that curteſie as to correct ſuch errours of the Preſſe that the ſecond Impreſsion may prevent. <hi>Seneca</hi> I remember is railed upon by ſlanderous tongues for the faults of <hi>Nero</hi> his Schollar. And the ſcapes of <hi>Quintilians</hi> Schollars, are imputed to <hi>Quintilian</hi> himſelf; but I know the Chriſtian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that is daily ſenſible of the <hi>Errata's</hi> of his life, hath not ſo learned Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Reader, I do not offer thee that which coſt me nothing: This Treatiſe that now I put into thy hand, is the fruit of much prayer and ſerious ſtudy: If thou findeſt any profit and benefit by it, give Chriſt all the glory; the crown of praiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes no head but his; only when thou art in the Mount, let me lie near thy heart: O pray earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, pray fervently, pray frequently, and pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weariedly, that I may have much of the freſh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointings of the holy Spirit, that my communion
<pb facs="tcp:104351:30"/> with a holy God may every day riſe higher and higher, and that all my tranſactions both before God and man may ſavour of ſome highths of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe: So thou wilt the more ſtrongly oblige me to be</p>

John 17.22. Luke 4 4. 1 Cor. 6.20. 1 Pet. 1.18, 19, 20. Heb. 9.12, 13, 14, 15.</note> O Sirs, our dear Lord Jeſus was infinitely tender of the ſouls of men; he left his Fathers boſome for ſouls, he trod the Wine-preſs of his Fathers wrath for ſouls; he prayed for ſouls; he payed for ſouls; he ſweated for ſouls; he bled out his heart blood for ſouls; and he made himſelf an offering for ſouls: and O what an encouragement ſhould this be to all his faithfull Meſſengers to woe for ſouls, to mourn for ſouls, to pray for ſouls, to ſtudy for ſouls, and in preaching to ſpend, and to be ſpent for the ſalvation of ſouls! Ah friends, there is no work, nor wiſdom on earth to that of winning ſouls, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.30. and <hi>He that winneth ſouls is wiſe.</hi> There is no Art, no induſtry to that of winning ſouls, of taking ſouls as Fowlers take Birds, as the Hebrew word (<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104351:35"/> beggarly. It is mans ſin, and judgement, that ever ſince he ceaſed to be what he ſhould be, he ſtriveth to ſeem to be what he is not: Thou ſayeſt thou art increaſed with goods, and needeſt nothing; I, but thou doſt but ſay ſo, thou doſt but dream it is ſo: for thou art ignorant of thine own wretched and lamentable eſtate; Thou ſayeſt thou art rich, but I know thou art poor and beggarly: if a dram of grace would ſave thy life, thy ſoul, thy family, nay, the whole world, thou haſt it not: Thou ſayeſt, thou ſeeſt: but thou art blind, thou art deſtitute of ſpiritual eye-ſight; thou ſeeſt not thine own wants, nor Chriſts worth: thine own emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, nor Chriſts fulneſs: thine own ſinfulneſs, nor Chriſts holineſs: thine own poverty, nor Chriſts (riches and) plenty; thine own miſery, nor Chriſts mercy: thine own inſufficiency, nor Chriſts alſufficiency: thine own vanity, nor Chriſts glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>&amp;c.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tinam omnes eſſent Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critae,</hi> Would to God that all were hypocrites: Without all peradventure, it is a very deſireable thing that all were out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly holy: yet all that reach to this, muſt go farther, or elſe they will ſit down on this ſide happineſs, Mat. 5.20. <hi>For I ſay unto you, that except your righteouſneſs ſhall exceed the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the kingdom of heaven:</hi> Now they were much in works of Piety, in works of Charity, in works of Equity, and in works of Curteſie, by which means they gained ſo much upon the hearts of the people, that it was commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited and voted among them, that if there were but two of all the world that ſhould go to heaven, the one ſhould be a Scribe, and the other a Phariſee. Yet your righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt exceed theirs, or the gates of glory will be ſhut
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104351:37"/> upon you. Their righteouſneſs and holineſs was only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, not internal; it was partial, not univerſal; it was rather circumſtantial then ſubſtantial: and therefore Heavens doors were double-bolted againſt them. Heaven is for that man, and that man is for heaven, that is not only outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy, but throughout holy.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There is a Relative holineſs; now Relative ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is a ſpecial relation which perſons or things have unto God. Relative holineſs includes two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, A ſeparation of perſons or things from common uſe: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and thus in the Law,<note place="margin">Deut. 19.2. 1 Kings 8.35. Ezra. 8.28. Chap. 10, 11. Iſa. 63.18.</note> thoſe things were called holy which were ſeparated from common uſe, and ſet apart for the Worſhip and Service of God: As the Oyl, Shewbread, Firſt-fruits, Incenſe, Altars, Veſtments; and in this ſenſe the Prieſts and Levites were called holy, becauſe they were ſeparated from others to ſerve in the Tabernacle. And in this ſenſe the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are frequently called a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified people, a holy people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> anſwers to the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which commonly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that which is appropriated to a holy uſe: and this is the proper notion of holineſs in the Old and New Teſtament, as I might ſhew you out of ſome hundred places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now certainly without this holineſs of ſpecial ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the common converſation of the world, there is no ſeeing of God, nor no fruition of God hereafter, 2 Cor. 6.17, 18. <hi>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye ſhall be my ſons and daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty.</hi> God will have no communion with any in this world that are not ſeparated from the ſinfull practiſes of the world. God will look upon none, he will own none, he will delight in none, he will acknowledge none, he will receive none for his ſons and daughters, but ſuch as are ſeparated from all evil vices, and unholy courſes. Suitable to this, is Iſa. 52.11. <hi>Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean things, go ye out of the midſt of her; Be ye clean that bear the veſſels of the Lord.</hi> Eſtrange your ſelves from them that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104351:38"/> are eſtranged from God;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cicero</hi> (though Heathen) had rather to have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion then a bad one.</note> have nothing to do with them that have nothing to do with God; ſeparate your ſelves from them who have ſeparated themſelves from God; have no delightfull converſe with them who have no delightfull converſe with God; have no boſome communion with them that have no boſome communion with God. Oh Sirs, you are to keep your ſelves as pure and clean from others defilements, as you would keep your ſelves free from others puniſhments: He that will imitate others in their ſins, ſhall certainly participate with others in their ſorrows. It is true we may live with wicked men in their Cities: but it is as true, we muſt not lie with wicked men in their enormities. There are many profeſſors that are like the Planet <hi>Mercury,</hi> good in conjunction with thoſe that are good, and bad with thoſe that are bad; but theſe wound many at once: God, Chriſt, the Goſpel, and their own credits and conſciences: Theſe do <hi>virtutis ſtragulam pudefacere,</hi> put virtue to an open ſhame: And theſe are deſervedly to be ſhamed by your ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from them, and by your renouncing all intimate commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or fellowſhip with them. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, As Relative holineſs takes in a ſeparation of perſons or things from common uſe,<note place="margin">2. So Chriſt is ſaid to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himſelf, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the ſins of his people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> ſo it takes in a dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and devoting of them to a holy uſe. And thus the Nazarites, Temple, Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> the Sabbath day, and other Feſtival dayes are ſaid to be holy under the Law. In ſhort, the whole Jewiſh Religion did lie in holy times, holy places, holy perſons, and holy things; and certainly without this holineſs, without this dedicating of our ſelves to God, we ſhall never come to a glorious fruition of God; he that doth not dedicate himſelf really to God, wholly to God, only to God, and alwayes to God on earth, ſhall never come to a ſight and viſion of God in heaven: if we do not give up our ſelves to God, God will never give up himſelf to us, Hoſ. 3.3. <hi>And I ſaid unto her, Thou ſhalt abide for me many dayes: thou ſhalt not play the harlot, and thou ſhalt not be for another man: ſo will I alſo be for thee.</hi> God will be only theirs that are really his: and he will be altogether theirs that are wholly his; he will only
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104351:38"/> be a husband to them that dedicate themſelves to him, as a wife doth to her husband: he will devote himſelf theirs, who devote themſelves his: he will avouch himſelf to be theirs who avouch themſelves to be his, Deut. 26.17, 18, 19. <hi>Thou haſt avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in his wayes, and to keep his Statutes, and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and his Judgements, and to hearken unto his voice. And the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promiſed thee, and that thou ſhouldſt keep all his commandments: And to make thee high above all Nations which he hath made in praiſe, and in name, and in honour, and that thou mayſt be a holy people unto the Lord thy God, as he hath ſpoken.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">That is an apt ſaying of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatio eſt ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid amittere ut majora lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creris:</hi> That is right mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe when ſomething is parted with to gain more.</note> God will reſign himſelf up to them who reſign themſelves up to him; he will give up himſelf to them that have given up their names and their hearts to him: He will beſtow himſelf as the greateſt pearle of price upon them that ſhall make a ſurrender of themſelves to him. There is no way to be higher then others, happier then others, more noble and honourable then others, then by making a <hi>dedi</hi>-gift of our ſelves to God. He that dedicates himſelf to God, dedicates all; he that doth not dedicate himſelf, dedicates nothing at all. What <hi>Eſchines</hi> once ſaid to <hi>Socrates,</hi> Others, ſaid he, give thee Gold, Silver, Jewels, but I give thee my ſelf: That muſt a Chriſtian ſay to his God, Ah Lord, there are ſome that give thee their lips, but I give thee my heart; others give thee good words, good expreſſions, but I give thee the beſt of my affections: others give thee a few cold prayers, but I give thee my whole ſoul: and had I as many hearts in my body as I have hairs on my head, I would give them all to thee: for thou art worthy, thou only art worthy. What the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> once ſaid to the King of <hi>Syria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Kings 20.4.</note> 
                  <hi>I am thine, and all that I have,</hi> that muſt a Chriſtian ſay to his Chriſt, <hi>I am thine O Lord, and all that I have.</hi> A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian muſt cry out with him who cried, Lord, I have two mites, a ſoul and a body, and I give them both to thee.<note place="margin">Bernard.</note> And this was the honour and commendations of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> that they gave up themſelves to the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. Having

Well, remember this: That man was never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally holy, that is not relatively holy; nor that man will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be really happy, that is not relatively holy: without Relative holineſs there will be no viſion of God in everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happineſs: We muſt be ſeparated from the corruptions and pollutions of the world, and we muſt dedicate our ſelves to God, or we ſhall never come to a future fruition of God. But,</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, There is an imputative holineſs, and that is the holineſs of Chriſt imputed to us. For to prevent miſtakes, you may pleaſe to take notice that there is a twofold ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in Chriſt:<note place="margin">Conſult theſe Scriptures, Luke 1.35. Mark 1.24. Heb. 7.26. Rom. 5.19. Col. 1.22. Rom. 2.3, 4. 2 Cor. 5.21, 22. Galat. 3.13. Jerem. 23.6.</note> firſt, there is his eſſential and perſonal holineſs as he is God: Now this eſſential holineſs of Chriſt cannot be imparted nor imputed to any mortal man; it is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to him. But Secondly, there is his mediatory holineſs, or that holineſs which he wrought for us as Mediator. Now the holineſs of Chriſt as Mediator did conſiſt both in the habitual holineſs of his perſon, in the abſence of all ſin, and in the rich and plentiful preſence of all holy and ſupernatural qualities, as alſo in the actual holineſs of his life and death: by his active obedience, by his ſubjecting of his heart and life to divine precepts, he perfectly fulfilled the commands of the Law: and by his paſſive obedience, his voluntary ſufferings, he fully ſatisfied the comminations, penalties, and curſes of the Law. Now this mediatory holineſs of Chriſts is ours by imputation, and by vertue of which we ſtand <hi>recti in curia,</hi> juſtified in the ſight of God, 1 Cor. 1.30. <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, and ſanctification, and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> This Mediatory holineſs of Chriſt reckoned unto a believing ſinner, is that whereby he is conſtituted holy <hi>in foro Dei;</hi> and upon this account they are ſaid to be all <hi>fair, Cant.</hi> 4.7.<note place="margin">Nemo-bonus, qui non ex malo bonus. <hi>Aug.</hi>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104351:39"/> this mediatory holineſs of Chriſt there is no appearing before God, there is no glorious viſion nor fruition of God.<note place="margin">Hab. 1.13.</note> God is a God of that infinite purity and holineſs, that no holineſs below the imputative holineſs of Chriſt can make a man ſtand before him, or bring a man to the fruition of him. It was a very ſweet and excellent ſaying of <hi>Bernard,</hi> when in his own opinion he was at the point of death: I confeſs (ſaid he) I am not worthy,<note place="margin">Guliel. Abbas in. vita Bern. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>12.</hi>
                  </note> I have no merits of mine own to obtain heaven by: but my Lord had a double right thereunto; An hereditary right, as a Son, and a Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious right as a Sacrifice: He was contented with the one right himſelf; the other right he hath given unto me; by the vertue of which gift, I do rightly lay claim unto it, and am not confounded. Though we cannot lay claim to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nor to a bleſſed fruition of God by any inherent holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in us, it being weak and imperfect; yet we may lay claim to both by the mediatory holineſs of Chriſt imputed to us. As Chriſts Eſſential holineſs gives him an hereditary right to everlaſting happineſs; So his Mediatory holineſs gives us a right to everlaſting bleſſedneſs. The coſtly cloak (of <hi>Alciſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>) which <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſold to the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Talents, was but a mean and beggarly ragg to that embroidered royal Robe of Chriſts mediatory holineſs, that is imputed or reckoned to us. And therefore as ever you would come to a viſion of God in happineſs, you muſt labour to be intereſted by faith in Chriſts mediatory holineſs. But,</p>
               <p>Sixthly and Laſtly, there is an inherent, internal quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> holineſs:<note place="margin">Holineſs is not any ſingle grace alone, but a conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation of all graces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note> Now this inherent holineſs lies in two things. Firſt, in the infuſing of holy principles, divine qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, or ſupernatural graces into the ſoul; ſuch as the Apoſtle mentions in Gal. 5.22, 23. <hi>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance; againſt ſuch there is no Law.</hi> Theſe habits of grace which are ſeverally diſtinguiſhed by the names of faith, love, hope, meekneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are nothing elſe but the new nature, or <hi>new-man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs,</hi> Epheſ. 4.24. Theſe ſeeds
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104351:40"/> of holineſs, theſe habits of grace are thoſe ſweet ointments with which all muſt be annointed,<note place="margin">1 John 3.9. 2 Cor. 1.21. 1 John 2.27.</note> that ſhall ever come to a bleſſed ſight or viſion of God. You may know much of God, you may hear much of God, you may talk much of God, and you may boaſt much of your hopes and intereſt in God, and yet without theſe habits of holineſs, you ſhall never, come to a bleſſed fruition of God in happineſs; without theſe feeds of holineſs, you ſhall never reap a crop of bleſſedneſs. But,</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, This inherent, this qualitative holineſs lies in an holy uſe and exerciſe of thoſe ſupernatural graces in a way of holy walking;<note place="margin">Acts 10.35. 1 John 1.3.7. Tit. 2.12. Luke 1.73. 2 Pet. 1.8. 1 Pet. 1.15, 16.

Gracious habits are the candles of the Lord ſet up in us: and God hath ſet up thoſe candles of heaven not to idle by, not to ſleep by, but to work by, and to walk by. Where there is holineſs of diſpoſition, there muſt be, nay, there will be holineſs of converſation; a holy heart is alwayes attended with a holy life:<note place="margin">Where there are the ſeeds of holineſs, there will be the flowers of holineſs.</note> you may ſeparate a man from his friend, but you can never ſeparate (though you may diſtinguiſh) acts of holineſs from the habits of holineſs: now it is certain without this holineſs, you ſhall never come to a ſight or fruition of God in happineſs. And thus I have ſhewed you what that holineſs is, without which there is no hope, no poſſibility of ever ſeeing the Lord.</p>

               <p>I come now to the ſecond thing, and that is, to prove the truth of the Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That without men are holy, they can never be happy; without holineſs on earth, none of the ſons of men ſhall ever come to a bleſſed viſion and fruition of God in heaven.

               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, God hath by very plain and clear Scriptures bolted and barred the door of heaven and happineſs againſt all unholy ones.<note place="margin">See alſo Mat. 7.21, 22, 23.

                  <hi>He cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</hi> The Scripture ſpeaks of ſeveral Cannots.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is a natural Cannot: now every ſon and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> daughter of <hi>Adam</hi> is by nature born under a Cannot; they are all born under a cannot believe, a cannot repent, a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love God, a cannot walk with God, a cannot ſee God, a cannot enjoy God, 1 Cor. 2.14. <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him:</hi> neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſcerned. A blind man cannot ſee colours, nor a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man cannot diſcern ſpiritual things: they are too high, they are too ſublime for him, they are myſteries that he cannot underſtand, that he cannot unriddle. The natural man can aſcend no higher then nature, as the water can riſe no higher then the ſpring from whence it comes.<note place="margin">Quantum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendit, tantum aſcendit.</note> The Scripture ſets ſuch ſad ſouls below the Ox, and the Aſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.3. Take nature civilized, and moralized, refined and raiſed, ſublimated, ſtrengthened, and improved to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and it cannot enable a man to do a ſupernatural acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nature cannot act <hi>ultra sphaeram,</hi> above it ſelf. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is a contracted and an habituated Cannot: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and of this Cannot the Prophet ſpeaks in Jer. 6.10. <hi>To
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104351:42"/> whom ſhall I ſpeak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold their ear is uncircumciſed, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the Lord is unto them a reproach: they have no delight in it:</hi> They had by their carnality, impiety, ſenſuality, ſecurity and obſtinacy, contracted upon their poor ſouls ſuch deafneſs, wretchedneſs, unteachableneſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractableneſs, that they could neither love the word, nor like it: they could neither take pleaſure nor delight in it; nay, they could neither hear it, nor bear it, though it never ſo near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned the internal and eternal welfare of their ſouls.<note place="margin">

Cuſtom in ſin takes away all conſcience of ſin, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. <hi>Can the Aethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots?
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104351:42"/> then may he alſo do good that is accuſtomed to do evil.</hi> The Ethiopian cannot make his black skin white: he cannot change the hew or the colour of it by waſhing; to attempt this is but labour in vain. Nor the Leopard cannot change his ſpots: no more can a poor ſinner that hath habituated and accuſtomed himſelf to ſin, that is deſperately enthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſin, turn from his ſin: The ſpots of the Leopard are not in him by accident but by nature: and they are ſuch which no Art can cure, nor water waſh off, becauſe they are not only in the skin, but in the fleſh and bones, in the ſinews and moſt inward parts. By cuſtom ſin hath beſpotted not only the skin, the life, the outſide of a poor ſinner, but alſo the very heart and ſoul of a poor ſinner, ſo as that he is never able to waſh off theſe ſpots. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> reports of one <hi>Theotimus,</hi> that having a diſeaſe upon his body, his Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an told him, that except he did abſtain from intemperance, drunkenneſs, uncleaneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he was like to loſe his eyes; his heart being habituated to ſin, and ſet upon wickedneſs, he anſwered, <hi>Vale lumen amicum,</hi> farwell ſweet light then. But,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as there is a contracted Cannot, an habituated <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Cannot, ſo there is a judicial Cannot. The Lord inflicts a judicial cannot upon many perſons in judgement: they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not return from their ſins, they cannot withſtand a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they cannot lay hold on eternal life, they cannot make ſure work for their ſouls, they cannot leave their boſome luſts, they cannot prefer Chriſt above all the world, they cannot make proviſion for eternity, they cannot ſee the things that belong to their peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this Cannot the Lord in wrath hath brought upon them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>And he ſaid, Go and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not: and ſee ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and ſhut their eyes;</hi> (or annoint, beſmeer, lime their eyes) <hi>leſt they ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Many men, ſaith <hi>Bernard</hi> do ſeek for ſtraws to put out their own eyes.</note>

When men are ſtifly and deſperately reſolved upon their ſinful courſes, when men grow ſtubborn, rebellious, licentious, and will wilfully wink and ſhut their eyes againſt the light, and ſtop their ears againſt the truth, God in his juſt judgement gives them up to dulneſs, ſtupidneſs, blindneſs, darkneſs, Iſa. 44.18. <hi>They have not known nor underſtood, for he hath ſhut their eyes that they cannot ſee;</hi>

Now whileſt men lie under theſe ſad Cannots, they can never ſee the kingdom of God. Theſe three Cannots like a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold cord, bind poor ſinners, ſo as that they can never come to a ſight or fruition of God in grace or glory till they are delivered from theſe Cannots, by a new birth, by being born again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>See the kingdom of God:</hi> that is, they cannot enter into it, they cannot enjoy it, they can have no childs part or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it, except they are new born, except they paſs the pangs of the ſecond birth. Let their education be never ſo ſweet, their illumination never ſo great, their profeſſion never ſo amiable, and their converſation never ſo unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; yet except they are new born, it had been good for them that they had never been born. And thus you ſee by plain Scriptures, that the Lord hath bolted the gates of glory againſt all unholy perſons.</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond Argument to prove, that without holineſs, there is no happineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is this; Without holineſs men are ſtrangers to God, and therefore without holineſs they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be admitted to a co-habitation with God. God loves not to dwell with ſtrangers, nor to aſſociate himſelf with ſtrangers; now ſuch are all unholy perſons, Epheſ. 2.12. <hi>That at time ye were without Chriſt, being aliens from the Common-wealth of</hi> Iſrael, (or being far removed from the Citizenſhip of <hi>Iſrael) and ſtrangers from the Covenants of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104351:43"/> promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the world.</hi> Here are five <hi>withouts</hi> in the words, 1. They were without God the Author of hope. 2. They were without Chriſt the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of hope. 3. They were without the Church (which was contained in the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) the place of hope. 4. They were without the Covenants of promiſe. (That is, they were without the precious promiſes which God in his Covenant had made, and oftentimes renewed with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and therefore called Covenants in the plural number) the ground and reaſon of hope. And Laſtly, they were without the grace of hope: they had no hope of communion with Chriſt, no hope of fellowſhip with the Saints; no hope of any intereſt in the promiſe; no hope of reconciliation to God here, nor no hope of a fruition of God hereafter. And thus you ſee what ſtrangers they were to the Lord, and to the great concernments of their own ſouls. God of old would not have ſtrangers come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Sanctuary: And do you think then that he will ever admit ſuch into heaven? Surely no. Ezek. 44.6.7, 9. <hi>And thou ſhalt ſay to the rebellious, even to the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, O ye houſe of</hi> Iſrael,<note place="margin">Heaven would be no heaven, were there any ſtrangers there.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>let it ſuffice you of all your abominations, In that ye have brought into my Sanctuary ſtrangers uncircumciſed in heart, and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in fleſh, to be in my Sanctuary to pollute it, even my houſe; when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my Covenant, becauſe of all your abominations. Thus ſaith the Lord God, No ſtranger uncircumciſed in heart, nor uncircumciſed in fleſh ſhall enter into my Sanctuary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 7.21, 22, 23. Ch. 25, 11, 12. Ch. 22.11, 12, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>of any ſtranger that is among the children of</hi> Iſrael. Such as had no holineſs within, nor no holineſs without: ſuch as had no holineſs in their hearts, nor no holineſs in their lives, God would not have them to enter into his Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and therefore certainly ſuch he will never ſuffer to enter into heaven. If God ſhuts the doors of an earthly Tabernacle againſt ſuch as were ſtrangers to him, to his Covenant, to his Church, and to themſelves, will he not much more ſhut the door of his heavenly Tabernacle againſt ſuch that are ſtrangers to him, and to his Chriſt,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104351:44"/> and to his word, yea, that are ſtrangers to their own ſouls, and to all the concernments of another world? and ſuch are all thoſe that are uncircumciſed in heart, and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in fleſh. Princes Pallaces are not for ſtrangers, but for ſons, friends, familiars, favourites; no more is the Pallace of heaven: we will not admit ſtrangers to cohabit with us: and will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Unholy perſons have fellowſhip and familiarity with Satan, and therefore doubtleſs God will have no familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nor fellowſhip with them.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.14, 15, 16.</note> As righteouſneſs can have no fellowſhip with unrighteouſneſs, nor light with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor Chriſt with Belial, nor heaven with hell, no more can a holy God have any communion or fellowſhip with unholy ſouls: for they are Satans houſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21. he keeps poſſeſſion of them as a man doth of his houſe,<note place="margin">Rev. 18.2.</note> and hath familiarity with them as a man hath with thoſe of his houſe: he is their Father, and they are his children, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. and look what familiarity a Father hath with his children, that hath an unholy devil with unholy ſouls.

By all which you may ſee what fellowſhip and familiarity there is between Satan and a ſinner. Now what is this leſs then blaſphemy to aſſert, that a holy God will have fellowſhip with them that have fellowſhip with the Devil? God hath not caſt Satan out of heaven, that he may make room for his familiars in heaven: if heaven was too holy to hold unholy devils, it will be found at laſt to be too holy to hold unholy ſouls; certainly they ſhall not lie in the boſome of God, who have the Devil for their bed-fellow.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Unholy perſons are full of contrariety to God; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> their natures, principles, practiſes, aims, minds, wills, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, judgements, intentions, and reſolutions,<note place="margin">Lev. 26.21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 40, 41.

Holineſs is the bond that ties God and ſouls together: God will cleave cloſe to them who in holineſs cleave faſt to him: but if he ſee uncleanneſs and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs among you, he will certainly turn away from you. The holy ſpirit gives the lye to thoſe that ſay they have fellowſhip with God, and yet maintain familiarity and fellowſhip with ſin, 1 John 1.6. <hi>If we ſay we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſs, we lye.</hi> The Apoſtle dares give the lye to any man (without fearing the ſtab) who pretends to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, and yet walks in darkneſs. Men may be much in Ordinances, and yet for want of holineſs may have no communion at all with God in Ordinances.

A ſpruce Roman riding on a lean Jade, was asked by the Cenſor his reaſon: he anſwered, I look to my ſelf, but my man to my horſe. So fools look only to their bodies, let who liſt look to their ſouls.

The Jews have a ſtory of a fooliſh woman that took two children to nurſe, the one very mean, deformed, crooked, blind, and not likely to live long: the other a goodly, lively, lovely, beautifull child, and likely to live long: now this fooliſh woman ſpent all her pains, care, diligence and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon the worſt child, never ſo much as minding

Surely no fools to theſe fools.</p>

God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that faithfull teachers ſhould put a difference between perſon and perſon, between the holy and prophane, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the clean and the unclean in all holy adminiſtrations. Jerem. 15.19. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord, If thou take forth the pretious from the vile, then thou ſhalt be as my mouth; let them return unto thee, but return not thou unto them.</hi> Now certainly if under the Ceremonial Law natural un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs did exclude and ſhut out the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from a participation in holy things, then certainly moral unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may juſtly exclude and ſhut out Chriſtians from a participation in holy things under the Goſpel, Mat. 7.6. <hi>Give not that which is holy unto dogs, neither caſt ye your pearls before ſwine, leſt they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rent you.</hi> Holy things are too precious to be ſpent and ſpilt upon ſwiniſh ſinners.

Fools are neither capable of doing good, nor of receiving good: and therefore what ſhould good ſouls do among ſuch! A fool hath neither an ear to hear, nor an eye to ſee, nor a heart to underſtand, nor a memory to retain, nor a will to chuſe, nor affections to embrace any thing that is good. And therefore their company is to be ſhunned and avoided. The ſociety of fools is as dangerous as it is vexations.

               <p>The tenth and laſt ſort of perſons that Chriſtians muſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> have no familiarity, nor ſociety with, are ſcorners. Such

Now certainly, if I may not reprove ſcorners, then I may not keep company with ſcorners, Prov. 22.10. <hi>Caſt out the ſcorner, and contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall go out, yea ſtrife and reproach ſhall ceaſe.</hi> The ſcorner muſt be caſt out of your family, and out of your company. Strife and contention, ſhame and reproach are the ſcorners attendants, and therefore he that would be rid of them, muſt caſt out him. The Hebrew word <hi>(Gereſh)</hi> here tranſlated <hi>caſt out,</hi> ſignifies not ſimply to eject or caſt out: but to caſt out or drive out, as God did drive <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.24. for the word is the ſame; and this God did as the Rabbins obſerve, with violence and diſpleaſure. So muſt the ſcorner be caſt out, or drove out. Look as God did drive out the <hi>Amorite</hi> and the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,</hi> and the <hi>Hittite,</hi> and the <hi>Perizzite,</hi> and the <hi>Hivite,</hi> and the <hi>Jebuſite</hi> before his people, <hi>Exodus</hi> 34.11. So muſt the ſcorner be driven out of the ſociety of the Saints; for the Hebrew word is the ſame in both places. Look as <hi>Sarah</hi> would have <hi>Abraham</hi> to caſt out the bond-woman and her Son, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.10. ſo muſt the ſcorner be caſt out of the company of the Saints; the word is ſtill the ſame. Look as the Sea caſteth up mire and dirt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.10. ſo ſhould Chriſtians caſt out ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from among them, the word being ſtill the ſame. The ſcorner conſtrues every thing to the worſt; he envies thoſe that excell him; he diſdains thoſe that are below him; he is never contented, never ſatisfied, he is ſtill a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling, ſtill a fretting, and ſtill a perplexing of himſelf and others; and therefore you muſt caſt him out with ſcoffing <hi>Iſmael,</hi> or the houſe will be too hot to hold you. Caſt out the firebrand, and the fire goes out; caſt out <hi>Jonah,</hi> and the ſtorm ſhall ceaſe; caſt out the bond-woman, and her ſcornfull ſon, and all will be quiet: <hi>Davids</hi> bleſſed man is deſribed by this,<note place="margin">Pſalm 1.1.</note> that <hi>he fits not in the ſeat of the ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi>

God himſelf ſcorns the ſcorner, Prov. 3.34. <hi>Surely he ſcorneth the ſcorner, &amp;c.</hi> of all men in the world God caſts the greateſt contempt and ſcorn upon ſcorners, and therefore why ſhould we make ſuch our boſome Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates?

In <hi>Joſiahs</hi> dayes when the Paſſeover was kept, there were Porters at every gate of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that no unclean or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed ones might enter.

And again, Church-officers (ſaith he) are to keep the Sacrament pure, as a man would keep a pleaſant ſpring clean whereat he uſeth to drink, not letting the feet of filthy beaſts and Swine to puddle it.

God hath long ſince reſolved upon it, that no unclean beaſts ſhall enter into heaven, that no dirty dogs ſhall ever trample upon that golden pavement: All in heaven are holy, the Angels holy, the Saints holy, the Patriarchs holy, the Prophets holy, the Apoſtles holy, the Martyrs holy, but the Lord himſelf above all is moſt glorious in holineſs, and therefore all thoſe holy ones do as it were in a divine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them ſing and ſay, <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,</hi>

No, as you may ſee in the ſecond verſe of that chapter: <hi>For they have taken of their daughters for themſelves, and for their ſons: ſo that the holy ſeed have mingled themſelves with the people of thoſe lands; yea, the hand of the Princes and Rulers have been chief in this treſpaſs.</hi> But how did this operate upon good <hi>Ezra!</hi> that you may ſee in the third verſe, <hi>And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and pluckt off the hair of my head, and of my beard, and ſate down aſtonied.</hi> Oh the ſorrow, the grief, the perplexity, the holy paſſion, the indignation, the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the aſtoniſhment that this abomination begot in the heart of good <hi>Ezra!</hi> The like effect this ſin had upon the heart of good <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> as you may ſee in that remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able text, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.23, 24, 25. compared with <hi>Ch.</hi> 10.29, 30.

Heart-purity ſpeaks a man eternally hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. Holineſſe is that noble principle that fits a man for the happieſt ſight of God: it makes a man a meet compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for God both here and herafter; without this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple no man can have communion with God in this world, much leſſe can he have communion with God in heaven, if this precious principle of holineſſe be not ſeated in his heart; it will not ſtand with the holineſſe of God, to have any thing to do with thoſe that have no principles of holineſs in them: It is a principle of holineſſe that fits a man for the ſervice of God, that fits a man for fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with God, that fits a man for walking with God, that fits a man for correſpondency with God, and that fits a man for the delight of God, and that fits a man for an everlaſting fruition of God. And therefore certainly without holineſſe there is no happineſſe; without a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of purity there can be no ſeeing of the face of God in glory.</p>

Hiſtory tells us of ſome ſcoffers that God hath ſtricken with madneſs: Others with blindneſs: others with loathſome diſeaſes: and ſome God hath ſtricken dead: and others he hath left to be their own Executioners. Scoffing at holineſs is a Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan ſin; and therefore no wonder if God executes upon ſcoffers Metropolitan judgements. Mockers and ſcoffers are the worſt of ſinners. Among the three ſorts of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that <hi>David</hi> mentions, Scorners have the chair. The chair of Peſtilence, as the Septuagint tranſlateth it.

But if you look into their hearts and lives, you will find them to be the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:104351:69"/> greateſt renouncers and denyers of Religion and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in the world. They have the ſemblance of golineſs, but not the ſubſtance; they have the lineaments of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, but not the life: they have the face of godlineſs, but not the heart: they have the form, the ſhadow of godlineſs, but not the power. They are like a well drawn picture which hath all the lineaments of a man, but wants life, wants a principle of motion and operation. Mark 1.<note place="margin">A form of godlineſs is <hi>Englands</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical diſeaſe.</note> The form of godlineſs is common, but the power of godlineſs is rare. 2.

The form of godlineſs is a credit, but the power of godlineſs is a reproach. 5. The form of godlineſs is pleaſurable and delightfull, but the power of godlineſs is diſpleaſing and undelightful (to the ignoble part of a Chriſtian.) 6. The form of godlineſs will ſtand with ſecret and with open wickedneſſe (as you ſee in <hi>Saul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Peter 1.17. Jer. 44.17.</note> 
                     <hi>Jehu, Judas, Simon Magus, Demas,</hi> and the Scribes and Phariſees) but the power of godlineſs will not; the power of godlineſs layes the Ax to the very root of all ſin, both ſecret and open. <hi>Rachel</hi> was very fair and beautifull to the eye, but ſhe was barren, and that marred all. So the Formaliſt, he is a very fair and beautifull Chriſtian to the eye, but he is barren God-wards, and Chriſt-wards, and Heaven-wards: he is fruitleſs, ſapleſs, and lifeleſs, and that marrs all. The Formaliſt takes up a form of godlineſs, 1. To quiet his conſcience: 2. To get himſelf a name. 3. To cloak over his ſins. 4. To ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his worldly intereſt: and 5. To avoid oppoſition and perſecution from the world, the fleſh, and the Devil. 6. And to conform to old cuſtoms. And what ſhould ſuch Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts do in heaven? A formal Chriſtian is but a figure, a flaunt, a flouriſh, a flaſh; and all he doth, is but the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of what he ſhould do. A formaliſt is more light then life, more notion then motion, more head then heart, more outſide then inſide, more leaves then fruit, more ſhadow then ſubſtance. A formaliſt is a blazing Comet, a painted Tomb, a Stage-player, a white devil, or a devil in an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104351:69"/> habit, and what ſhould ſuch devils do in heaven? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if without real holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord; then the formaliſt (that hath only the ſhape, the ſhew, the form of godlineſs, but nothing of the reality and power of it) ſhall never be bleſt with ſuch a ſight: A formaliſt is neither hot nor cold; of all ſorts of ſinners he is the worſt, and God ſo loaths him, that he is reſolved he will rid his ſtomack of him, Rev. 3.16. <hi>I will ſpue thee out of my mouth:</hi> and certainly, heaven is too holy a place to lick up that gorge God hath caſt up. Lukewarm water cannot be ſo loathſome to our ſtomacks, as a formaliſt is to Gods. God is never at ſuch eaſe, as when he hath caſt up, and caſt out the formal Chriſtian.<note place="margin">Magdenburge Cent. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> I have read of <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, how God ſhot him to death with a thunder-bolt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his lukewarmneſs and formality.

                  <p>Fourthly, If real holineſs be the only way to happineſs: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> if men muſt be holy on earth, or elſe they ſhall never ſee the face of God in heaven: Then this truth by way of conviction looks ſowerly and ſadly upon all thoſe who pleaſe and ſatisfie themſelves with civility and common honeſty: who are good negative Chriſtians, who bleſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they are no ſwearers, nor drunkards,<note place="margin">Luke 18.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Mat. 5.21. Chap. 19.20, 21, 22.</note> nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners, nor adulterers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they pay every man his own, they are juſt and righteous in their dealings; no man can ſay black is their eye; their carriage is civil, comely, harmleſs and blameleſſe. <hi>They make a fair ſhew in the fleſh, Gal.</hi> 6.12. or as the Greek hath it, they ſet a good face on it. But as good a face as they do ſet on it, I muſt crave leave to tell them that civility is not ſanctity; civility reſted in, is but a beautifull abomination, a ſmooth way to hell and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. I may truly ſay of all civil men (who are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of that real holineſs that leads to happineſs) what <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſaid of <hi>Seneca,</hi> If you look upon him as a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, then he ſeemeth to write as if he were a Chriſtian;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104351:70"/> but if you look upon him as a Chriſtian, then he ſeemeth to write as a heathen. So if you look upon many civil moral mens lives, you will find them ſo full of ingenuity, equity, righteouſneſs, ſweetneſs and juſtice, that you will be ready to ſay, Sure theſe are holy men. But then do but obſerve how unacquainted they are with God, with Chriſt, with the Scripture, with the way and working of the ſpirit, with the filthineſs of ſin, with the depths and devices of Satan, with their own hearts, with the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, and with the great concernments of eternity, and you will judge them to be meer heathens, to be men void of all principles of grace and holineſs; and to be meer ſtrangers to union and communion with Chriſt, and to the more ſecret and inward operations and workings of the ſpirit of Chriſt, and to the moſt ſpiritual duties and ſervices that are commanded by Chriſt. Civility is very often the nurſe of impiety,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.19, 20, Acts 7.54. Chap. 13.50. Ch. 17.17, 18. Romans 8.7.</note> the mother of flattery, and an enemy to real ſanctity: a high conceit of civility keeps many a man from looking after inward and outward purity: moral honeſty proves to many men a bond of iniquity. There are thoſe who are ſo blinded with the fair ſhews of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that they can neither ſee the neceſſity, nor beauty of ſanctity: there are thoſe that now bleſs themſelves in their common honeſty, whom at laſt God will ſcorn and caſt off for want of real holineſs and purity.<note place="margin">Matth. 25.3.11, 12. As <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> ſo <hi>Socrates, Plato, Titus Veſpatian, Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of others amongſt the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Grecians, Romans,</hi> &amp;c.</note> Many of the Heathens were ſo famous for juſtice and righteouſneſs, for equity, fidelity and ſobriety, for civility and moral hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, that it would put many profeſſors to the bluſh to read what is written of them: and yet there was ſuch a tincture of popular applauſe, of pride and vain glory, of hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and ſelf-flattery, upon their civility and moral honeſty, that for any thing we can find in Scripture to the contrary, there is cauſe to fear that they ſhall be miſerable to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: for all their civility and moral honeſty, they were left in a damnable, I will not ſay in a damned condition: he that riſes to no higher pitch then civility and moral hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, ſhall never have communion with God in glory. <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was a great man but a Leper,<note place="margin">2 Kings 5.1:</note> 
                     <hi>Naaman</hi> was an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104351:70"/> man, but a Leper; <hi>Naaman</hi> was a mighty man, but a Leper; <hi>Naaman</hi> was a victorious man but a Leper; <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was in high favour and eſteem with his Prince, but a Leper. This <hi>but he was a Leper,</hi> ſtained all his honour, and was a blot upon all his greatneſs and glory, both at Court, and in the field; both in the City, and in the Countrey. So it is a ſtain, a blot upon the moſt moral honeſt man in the world to ſay, he is a very civil honeſt man, but Chriſtleſs: he is a very juſt man, but graceleſs; he is a man of much moral righteouſneſs, but he hath not a dram of real holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This <hi>but</hi> is a fly in the box of ointment that ſpoils all. Well Sirs, remember this, though the moral honeſt man be good for many things, yet he is not good enough to go to heaven, he is not good enough to be made glorious, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.20. Certainly, there is nothing in all the world below real ſanctity, that will ever bring a man to the poſſeſſion of glory. And though it may grieve us (to ſpeak after the manner of men) to ſee ſweet natures, to ſee many moral honeſt men take many a weary ſtep towards heaven, and to come near to heaven, and to bid fair for heaven, and yet after all to fall ſhort of heaven: yet it will be no way grievous to a holy God to turn ſuch ſweet natures into hell, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.17. moral honeſty is not ſufficient to keep a man out of eternal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; all it can do is to help a man to one of the beſt rooms and eaſieſt beds that hell affords. For look as the moral mans ſins are not ſo great as others, ſo his puniſhments ſhall not be ſo great as others. This is all the comfort that can be afforded to a moral man, that he ſhall have a cooler hell then others have: but this is but cold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Moral honeſty without piety is as a body without a ſoul, and will ever God accept of ſuch a ſtinking ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Surely no.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If real holineſs be the only way to happineſs; if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> men muſt be holy on earth, or elſe they ſhall never come to a fruition of God in heaven; then this truth by way of conviction looks ſowerly and ſadly upon all Neuters, who divide their hearts between God and Mammon,<note place="margin">Matth 6.29.</note> who halt

A Neuter is a monſter; he hath two tongues, two minds, and two ſouls: he hath a tongue for God, and a tongue for the world too; he looks up to God and ſaith Certainly thou art mine; he looks down upon the world, and ſaith Surely I am thine; He hath a mind to be religious, and a mind to ſave his own ſtake in the world too.

As you may ſee in the ſame perſon, <hi>he loved the wages of unrighteouſneſs:</hi> he loved it as his portion, he loved it as his life, he loved it as his happineſs, he loved it as his all; he loved it as his ſoul, yea, he loved it above his own ſoul, for he damned his ſoul to gain it. It is true, when he was under a divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, he profeſſed that he would not curſe the people of God for a houſe full of Gold; but when he was from under that reſtraint, his heart was ſo ſet upon the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous reward, that he would have curſt them for a handfull of gold. The Neuter (as the Romans paint <hi>Eraſmus</hi>) hangs between heaven and earth; He is neither fit to go to heaven, nor yet worthy to live on earth. If <hi>Meroz</hi> was to be certainly curſt, to be bitterly curſt, to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally curſt (as the Hebrew phraſe, <hi>curſing curſe ye Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roz</hi> imports, in <hi>Judges</hi> 5.23.) for ſtanding Neuter, when they ſhould have come forth to the help of the Lord: Do you think that Neuters in religion ſhall be bleſt?

And why then ſhould not Chriſtians upon the account of a poſſibility, make a diligent ſearch after that holineſs, that will at laſt throne the ſoul in everlaſting happineſs? Well, Chriſtians, as a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104351:76"/> poſſibility of obtaining grace and mercy, ſhould bear up your hearts againſt deſpair:<note place="margin">Matth. 9.26. Mark 10 27. Chap. 14.36. Mark 9.23.

Let no man do more upon the account of a poſſibility for this world, then you will do upon the account of a poſsibility for another world: Let no man do more upon the account of a poſſibility for his body, then you will do upon the account of a poſſibility for your ſouls: Let no man do more upon the account of a poſsibility for temporals, then you will do upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a poſſibility for eternals. It is poſſible for you to know whether this babe of grace, Holineſs, be formed in your ſouls or no; and therefore ſearch and enquire after it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider this, that it is a point of very great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> concernment to you, to know whether you have this real holineſs or no; your ſouls lies upon it; eternity lies upon it;<note place="margin">Pſalm 4.5.</note> your All lies upon it; and an errour here, may make a man miſerable for ever; it is good for thee to know the ſtate of thy body, the ſtate of thy family, the ſtate of thy flock;<note place="margin">

There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes to make up my miſtakes about temporals, but there is no way to make up my miſtakes about eternals: If at laſt I ſhall be ſound to be miſtaken in the great concernments of my ſoul, I am undone for ever. Well Sirs, you are in a ſtate of nature, or in a ſtate of grace; you are in a ſtate of darkneſs, or in a ſtate of light; you are in a ſtate of life, or in a ſtate of death; you are in a ſtate of love, or in a ſtate of wrath; you are either Goats or Sheep, Sons or Slaves; you are either in the broad way to deſtruction, or in the narrow way of ſalvation; and therefore what can be of greater concernment in this world to you, then to know in which of theſe two ſpiritual eſtates you are in? How can you order aright your prayers, or your praiſes, or any reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſervices, till you come to know in which of theſe two ſpiritual eſtates you ſtand! whether you be in a ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or in a ſtate of grace; in a ſtate of ſin, or in a ſtate of holineſs; for all religions duties muſt be ordered according to mens ſpiritual eſtates. If a man be in a ſtate of nature, his work lies one way; if he be in a ſtate of holineſs, his work lies another way: By all which it is moſt evident that it very nearly concerns you to ſearch and try, whether you have this bird of Paradiſe, Holineſs, in your boſoms, or no: And for a cloſe, let me ſay, that a miſtake about your ſpiritual

                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider, That a cordial willingneſs to enter upon this work of tryal, is a hopefull evidence of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al integrity and ſanctity. Unſanctified ſouls hate the light; they had rather go to hell in the dark, then come to be weighed in the ballance of the Sanctuary. As pure gold fears neither fire nor furnace, neither teſt nor touchſtone;<note place="margin">John 3.20.</note> neither one ballance nor another, ſo a pure heart, a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſoul dares venture it ſelf upon tryal: yea,<note place="margin">Job 31.5, 6.

As Bankrupts care not for caſting up their accounts, becauſe they know all is naught, very naught, ſtark naught with them: ſo unſanctified ſouls, they care not to come to the tryal, to the teſt, becauſe they know that all is naught, yea worſe then naught with them: They have no mind to caſt up their ſpiritual eſtates, becauſe at the foot of the account they muſt be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And therefore as old deformed women cannot indure to look into the looking-glaſs, leaſt their wrinckles and deformity ſhould be diſcovered, ſo unſanctified ſouls cannot endure to look into the glaſs of the Goſpel, leaſt their deformities, impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and wickedneſſes ſhould be diſcovered and detected. I have read of the Elephant, how unwilling he is to go into the water, but when he is forced into it, he puddles it leſt by the clearneſs of the ſtream he ſhould diſcern his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity. So unholy perſons are very unwilling to look into their own hearts, or into the clear ſtreams of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, leſt their ſouls deformity and uglineſs ſhould appear to their own terror and amazement. And therefore as you would have a hopefull evidence of your integrity and ſanctity, fall upon this work of tryal.

There are many that carry the Lamps of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that have no oyle of grace in their hearts: There are many that take a good nature for grace, civility for ſanctity, and a garb of godlineſs for real holineſs; yea, there are thoſe who dare ſay that they excell others in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, when in truth they exceed moſt men in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Yea, there are many now in hell, who have had a great confidence of going to heaven. There are many that cry out with <hi>Agag, Surely the bitterneſs of death is paſt:</hi> wrath is paſt, and hell is paſt, and damnation is paſt, when as ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is ready to fall on them, and hell ſtands gaping to devour them. The heart of man is full of ſelf-love, full of ſelf-flattery, and full of hypocriſie, and therefore many a man who is only a Jew outwardly,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.28, 29.</note> thinks himſelf to be a Jew inwardly: many a man thinks himſelf to be as good a Chriſtian as the beſt, and to be as happy as the beſt, and to be as fair for heaven as the beſt, till he comes to hear that tormenting word, <hi>Depart, I know ye not.</hi> As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are kept off from Chriſt, by a conceit that they have
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104351:78"/> him already: ſo many are kept off from holineſs, by a conceit that they have it already. And therefore it doth very much concern you to make a diligent enquiry, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have that holineſs without which there is no happineſs, or no. I have read of <hi>Plato,</hi> that when he did walk in the ſtreets, if he ſaw any diſordered in ſpeech, diſguiſed in drink, or otherwiſe our of frame, he would ſay to himſelf, <hi>Num ego talis,</hi> Am I ſuch a one as this is? Am I ſuch a ſwearer as this is? Am I ſuch a drunkard as this is? Am I ſuch a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton as this is? Am I ſuch a royotous perſon as this? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So ſhould every Chriſtian ſay when he hears of any that doth but think that they ſtand, <hi>Num ego talis:</hi> Am I ſuch a one as this is? When he ſees one that thinks himſelf ſomething when he is nothing, he ſhould ſay Am I ſuch a one as this is? when he ſees a man to have a form of godlineſs but no power, he ſhould ſay, Am I ſuch a one as this is? when he hears of a man that hath a name to live, but is ſpiritually dead, he ſhould ſay, Am I ſuch a one as this is, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> and when he hears or reads of one that is really holy, he ſhould ſay am I ſuch a one as this is; As you would not put a cheat upon your own ſouls, it highly concerns you to try whether you have real holineſs or no. Look, as many young children catch many a fall out of a ſtrong conceit of their abilities to go: ſo many a man out of a ſtrong conceit that he hath holineſs when he hath none, catches many a fall in an eternal fall at laſt. The beſt way to prevent an everlaſting miſcarriage, is to make a privy ſearch after holineſs in thine own heart.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Conſider that there is a great deal of counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> grace and holineſs in the world: There is not more counterfeit coin this day in the world, then there is counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit holineſs in the world.

                  <p>Sixthly, Conſider, If upon tryal you ſhall find in you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> this real holineſſe that paves the way to happineſs, it will turn exceedingly to your accounts: thy happineſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the real being of holineſſe (in thee) but thy comfort depends upon thy ſeeing of holineſſe. Real holineſſe will yield thee a heaven hereafter; but the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of holineſſe will yield thee a heaven here: he that hath holineſſe and knows it, ſhall have two heavens; a heaven of joy, comfort, peace, content and aſſurance here; and a heaven of happineſſe and bleſſedneſſe hereafter; but he that hath holineſs and doth not know it, ſhall certainly be ſaved,<note place="margin">1 Co. 3.11, 16.</note> yet ſo as by fire; he ſhall have a heaven at laſt, but he muſt paſſe to it by the flaming ſword.

And O who then will not take ſome pains with his own heart, to know the goodneſſe and holineſſe of his own eſtate! Well, remember this, next to a mans being holy, it is the greateſt mercy in this world to know that he is holy. But if upon trial a man ſhall find that his eſtate is bad, and that his holineſſe is not of the right ſtamp, yet this will be many wayes a mercy, and an advantage to him. For the way to be found, is to ſee your ſelves loſt; the way to infinite mercy, is to ſee your own miſery: the way to <hi>Canaan,</hi> is through the wilderneſſe: the way to heaven, is by the gates of hell: upon the knowledge of the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſadneſſe of thy eſtate, thou wilt be awakened out of thy ſecurity, and thou wilt be alarmed to loath thy ſelf, to judge thy ſelf, ro condemn thy ſelf, to be ſick of ſin,<note place="margin">Acts. 2.37, 42.

As the treaſures of this world often lye obſcure and hid in the bowels of the earth: ſo the treaſures of holineſſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten lie obſcure and hid in many a gracious ſoul, for want of a privy ſearch, As it is one mercy for me to believe, and another mercy for me to know that I do believe;<note place="margin">1 John 5.13.

So it is one mercy for me to have real holineſſe in me: and another mercy for me to ſee it, and to know it: As we many times complain of the want of thoſe things that we have in our hands: ſo many dear Chriſtians complain of the want of that holineſſe that they have in their hearts. As the well,<note place="margin">Gen 21 16, 17, 18, 19.</note> the ſpring of water was neer to <hi>Hagar</hi> though ſhe ſaw it not; ſo the ſpring of holineſſe is neer to many a Chriſtian, yea it is in many a Chriſtian, and yet he ſees it not,<note place="margin">Gen. 28.16.</note> he knows it not. As <hi>Jacob</hi> once ſaid, <hi>The Lord was in this place, and I knew it not:</hi> So many a precious ſoul may ſay, I had real holineſſe in my heart, and I knew it not. As the face of <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſhine,<note place="margin">Exod 34.29. ult.</note> but he ſaw it not, he knew it not, though others did ſee it and take notice of it: ſo holineſſe ſhines in many a Chriſtians heart and life, yet cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions raiſe ſuch a duſt in his ſoul that he ſees it not, he knows it not, though others can ſee it, take notice of it, and bleſſe and admire the Lord for it. As there be ſome that think they are rich,<note place="margin">Rev 3.16, 17.

Mark 8.18.</note> when they have not; yea that ſay they have holineſſe when they have not. So there be others that have real holineſſe, and yet they dare not think ſo, they dare not ſay ſo. Yea they are apt in times of temptation, deſertion, ſore afflictions, and when they are under the ſenſible ſtirrings of ſtrong corruptions, to conclude that they have no holineſſe, no grace, when indeed they have: witneſſe <hi>Job, Chap.</hi> 13.24.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104351:81"/> but wo were to many precious Chriſtians if they might not be holy and yet not know it; if they might not have holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their hearts, when the appearance of holineſs is hid from their eyes. Look as ſparks and coals of fire are often hid under the aſhes and we ſee them not; and as in Winter the ſap and life is hid in the root of the tree, and we perceive it not; and as precious flowers are hid in their ſeeds, and we diſcern them not; ſo when it is Winter with a Chriſtian, his holineſs may be ſo hid and covered under fears, doubts, ſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he may not be able to ſee it, to diſcern it, or conclude that he hath it: As the air is ſometimes clear, and ſometimes cloudy, and the Sea ſometimes ebbing and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times flowing; ſo the holineſs of the Saints is ſometimes ſo clouded, and at ſo low an ebb, that a Chriſtian can hardly diſcern it, he can hardly ſay, Lo here is my holineſs; the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of holineſs in the ſoul is one thing; the ſeeing of holineſs in the ſoul is another thing; the being of holineſs is one thing; the feeling of holineſs is another thing. A Chriſtian may as ſafely conclude that there are no ſtars in the sky in a dark night, becauſe he cannot ſee them; and that there is no treaſure in the Mine, becauſe he cannot diſcern it, nor come to the feeling of it, as he may conclude that he hath no holineſs in his heart, becauſe he cannot ſee it, he cannot feel it. As the treaſures of this world,<note place="margin">Prov. 2.3, 4, 5, 6.</note> ſo the treaſures of holineſs often-times he low: a man muſt dig deep before he can come at them.

All worldly excellencies in the judgement of a holy man, are but as Copper, Braſs, Tin and Lead; but holineſs is the tryed ſilver, the gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> the pearl of price in his eye that hath purity in his heart. They only rate and value men aright, who rate and value them according to their holineſs; and if men were thus rated and valued, moſt men in the world would be found not worth the money that <hi>Judas</hi> ſold his Maſter for. If thou prizeſt others for their holineſs, thou art a holy perſon; no man can truly prize and highly value holineſs in another, but he that hath holineſs in his own heart. Some prize Chriſtians for their wit, others prize them for their wealth; ſome prize them for their birth and breeding, others prize them for their beauty and worldly glory; ſome prize them for the great things that have been done by them, others prize them for the good things that they have received from them; ſome prize them for their Eagles eyes, others prize them for their ſilver tongues; but he that is truly holy, prizes them for their holineſs, he values them for their purity and ſanctity.

When he is in proſperity, he hopes that God will make him more zealous, thankfull, cheerfull, fruitfull and uſefull; and when he is in Adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he hopes that God will inflame his love, and raiſe his faith, and increaſe his patience, and ſtrengthen his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and quiet his heart in a gracious reſignation of himſelf to God. I dare boldly ſay that that man was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truly holy who endeavours not to get up to the higheſt pitches of holineſs: True holineſs knows no reſtrictions,<note place="margin">Ille non eſt bonus, qui non vult eſſe melior.</note> nor limitation.

A holy man knows, that all ſin ſtrikes at the holineſſe of God, the glory of God, the nature of God, the being of God, and the Law of God: and therefore his heart riſes againſt all; he looks upon every ſin, as the Scribes and Phariſees that accuſed Chriſt; and as that <hi>Judas</hi> that betrayed Chriſt; and that <hi>Pilate</hi> that condemned Chriſt; and thoſe Souldiers that ſcourged Chriſt; and as thoſe ſpears that pierced Chriſt; and therefore his heart cries out for Juſtice upon all. He looks upon every ſin as having a hand in the death of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and therefore he cries out Crucifie them all, crucifie them all; he looks upon every ſin as a grieving of the ſpirit, as a vexing of the Spirit,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.30.

And as no unholy heart riſes againſt all ſin; ſo no unholy heart diſdains ſin or riſes againſt ſin upon noble accounts, upon holy and heavenly accounts: Sometimes you ſhall have an unholy perſon angry with ſin, and falling out with ſin, becauſe in hath

So many a man is eternally ſlain by the little ſins that he nouriſhes in his own boſome: as a

A Chriſtian is to hate not only the fleſh, but the garment; and not only the garment which is beſmeared, but the very garment that is (but) beſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the fleſh. <hi>Jude</hi> 23. Our firſt Parents were not only forbidden to eat of the forbidden fruit, but they were forbidden to touch it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.3. And certainly, he that would not gape after forbidden fruit, muſt not gaze upon forbidden fruit: He that would not long after it, muſt not look upon it; he that would not taſte it,<note place="margin">Numb. 6.3, 4.</note> muſt not touch it. The pious Nazarite was not only commanded to abſtain from wine and ſtrong drink, but alſo from eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grapes, whether moiſt or dry: yea, he was prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from eating any thing that was made of the vine-tree from the kernels, even to the husk. Leſt by the ſweet and contentment of any of theſe, he ſhould be tempted or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed to drink wine, and ſo forget the Law,<note place="margin">Prov. 31.5. <hi>Difficile quis venenum bibet, &amp; vivet.

Sin is ſo hatefull a thing that both the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote occaſion, and the leaſt occaſion that might draw the ſoul to it, is to be avoided and ſhunned as a man would avoid and ſhun hell it ſelf. He that truly hates the nature of ſin, cannot but hate the leaſt ſin, yea, all appearances of ſin. A holy heart knows that the very thought of ſin, if not thought on, will break forth into action, action in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to cuſtom, cuſtom into habit, and then body and ſoul are undone for ever. Look, as nothing ſpeaks out more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and real ſanctity, then ſhunning the very appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of vanity: ſo nothing ſpeaks out more indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt ſin, then the avoiding the occaſions of ſin. But,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, A holy heart knows, that the indulging of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of the leaſt ſin is ground ſufficient for any man to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his integrity and ingenuity towards God; he hath

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, and laſtly, (take many things in one) A holy heart knows that the leaſt ſin coſt Chriſt his deareſt blood: without ſhedding of blood there was no remiſſion, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of great ſins,<note place="margin">Hebrews 9.22.</note> nor no remiſſion of little ſins. He knows that the blood of Chriſt is as requiſite to cleanſe the ſoul from the leaſt ſin, as it is to cleanſe it from the greateſt, 1 John 1.7. <hi>And the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all our ſins.</hi> It is not the caſting of a little holy water upon us: it is not the Papiſts Purgatories,<note place="margin">About little ſins, you may ſee more in my <hi>Precious Remedies againſt Satans Devices. pag.</hi> 22.34.</note> nor their whippings, nor St. <hi>Francis</hi> his kiſſing or licking of our ſores, nor a Biſhops bleſſing, nor a few knocks on the breaſt, nor a few tears dropping from our eyes, that can cleanſe us from the leaſt ſin. No, it is only the blood of Chriſt that cleanſeth us from all our ſins; there is not the leaſt ſpot in a Chriſtians heart that can be waſht out, but in the blood of the Lamb. When
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104351:90"/> Satan appeared and preſented to a dying man in a long Parchment Role his Idle words, his falſe words, his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry words, his wanton words, and his more wicked words and deeds: The dying man anſwered, All this is true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, but yet there is one thing more for thee to ſet down under all my ſins, and that is this, <hi>The blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all our ſins.</hi> Whereupon the devil vaniſhed, as being vanquiſhed. Certainly, there is not a vain thought, nor an Idle word, nor an angry word, not a wanton word that can be pardoned or cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt. The remembrance of which cannot but ſtir up a holy indignation in a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoul againſt the leaſt corruption. When <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> the Emperour was murdered, <hi>Antonius</hi> brought forth his bloody Coat, and ſhewed it to the people, which ſtirred up in them ſuch an indignation againſt the murderers, that they cryed out, Slay the murderers, and went and burnt their houſes, and all that was in them. So when a holy heart looks upon his ſins, yea his little ſins, as thoſe that have murdered the Prince of glory, ah what an indignation doth it raiſe in the ſoul againſt them! A holy heart knows that there is not the leaſt ſin, but doth in a meaſure eſtrange the ſoul from God; as little clouds do ſomewhat interpoſe between the Sun and us; ſo little ſins do ſomewhat inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe between God and our ſouls: and as ſometimes a little matter, a miſtake or lending an ear; or a word out of joint, or an act of forgetfulneſs doth occaſion ſome diſtance between deareſt friends: ſo ſometimes little ſins do occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſome diſtance between our deareſt God and our ſouls.<note place="margin">Acts 15.36. ult. Prov. 16.28. Chap 17.9.</note> A holy heart knows that Chriſt looks upon thoſe ſins as great, which the blind world accounts but little. Chriſt accounts hatred, murder, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.15. A wanton eye, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.28. And he reckons the officious lie, and the merry lie amongſt the moſt monſtrous ſins, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns it to the loweſt hell. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. The conſideration of all which raiſes no ſmall indignation in a holy heart againſt the leaſt, the ſmalleſt ſin. But now unholy hearts make nothing of little ſins; with <hi>Achan</hi> they will be bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaves
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:104351:91"/> for a wedge of gold: with <hi>Gehazi</hi> they will be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of unrighteouſneſs for a talent of ſilver,<note place="margin">2 Kings 5.22, 23.</note> and two changes of garments: with <hi>Adam</hi> they will tranſgreſs for n Apple: and with <hi>Eſau</hi> they will ſell their birth-right of grace here, and of glory hereafter, for a meſs of Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. The hearts of unholy perſons may riſe againſt groſs ſins, ſuch as are not only againſt the Law of God, but againſt the light and laws of nature, and Nations; their ſouls may riſe in arms againſt thoſe ſins that makes them liable to the laws of men, or that layes them open to ſhame, fear, grief, or loſſe: But as for vain thoughts, idle words, petty oaths, ſinfull motions, and frequent omiſſions, they look upon theſe as trifles, motes and gnats that are not to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or bewailed. But,</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, As a holy heart riſes againſt the leaſt ſins: So a holy heart riſes againſt boſome ſins, againſt conſtitution ſins, againſt thoſe that either his calling, former cuſtom, or his preſent inclination or condition do moſt diſpoſe him to. It is true, a prodigal perſon may abhorr covetetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a covetous perſon may condemn prodigality: A furious perſon may hate fearfulneſs; and a fearfull perſon may deteſt furiouſneſs. But now the hearts of thoſe that are holy riſe againſt complexion ſins, againſt darling ſins, againſt thoſe that make for preſent pleaſure and profit, againſt thoſe that were once as right hands, and right eyes; that were that to their ſouls, that <hi>Dalilah</hi> was to <hi>Sampſon, Herodias</hi> to <hi>Herod, Iſaac</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> to <hi>Jacob,</hi> Pſalm 18.23. <hi>I was alſo upright before him; and I kept my ſelf from mine iniquity,</hi> That is, from my darling ſin where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I was moſt inclined and addicted. What this boſome ſin was that he kept himſelf from,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.29.</note> is hard to ſay. Some ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his darling ſin was lying, diſſembling; for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, he often fell into this ſin: Others ſuppoſe it to be ſome ſecret iniquity, which was only known to God and his own conſcience. Others ſay it was uncleanneſs, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he prayed, that <hi>God would turn away his eyes from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding vanity, Pſalm</hi> 119.37. Others judge it to be that ſin of diſloyalty which <hi>Saul</hi> and his Courtiers falſly charged
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104351:91"/> upon him. It is enough for our purpoſe that his heart did riſe againſt that very ſin,<note place="margin">Jer. 44.15.20. Iſa. 1.29. ch. 57.5. Ier. 17.1, 2. Hoſea 2.8. Iſa. 31.6, 7.</note> that either by cuſtom or ſome ſtrong inclination he was moſt naturally apt, ready and prone to fall into. Idolatry was the darling ſin of the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:</hi> they called their Idols <hi>delectable,</hi> or <hi>deſireable things, Iſa</hi> 44.9. they did dearly affectand delight in their Idols; but when God ſhould come to put a ſpirit of holineſſe upon them, then their hearts ſhould riſe in hatred and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of their Idols, as you may ſee in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18.25. mark <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>Ye ſhall defile alſo the covering of thy graven Images of Silver, and the ornament of thy molten Images of gold: thou ſhalt caſt them away as a menſtrous cloth, thou ſhalt ſay unto it, Get thee hence.</hi> They were ſo delighted and enamoured with their Idols, that they would deck then up in the greateſt glory and bravery, they would attire them with the moſt rich, coſtly,<note place="margin">After the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the Jews out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they ſo hated &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred Idols, that in the time of the Romans they choſe rather to die, then to ſuffer the Eagle which was the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Arms to be ſet up in their Temple.</note> pompous and glorious ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. O but when a ſpirit of holineſſe ſhould riſe upon them, then they ſhould defile, deface, and diſgrace their Idols, then they ſhould ſo hate and abhor them, they ſhould ſo deteſt and loath them, that in a holy indignation they ſhould caſt them away as a menſtrous cloth, and ſay unto them, get ye hence, pack, be gon, I will never have any more to do with you. God hath now made an everlaſting divorce between you and me. And ſo in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.20. <hi>In that day,</hi> (that is, in the day of the Lords exaltation in the hearts, lives and conſciences of his people, <hi>ver.</hi> 17.) <hi>a man ſhall caſt his Idols of ſilver, and his Idols of gold, which they made, each one for himſelf to worſhip, to the moles and to the Bats.</hi> In the day of Gods exaltation they ſhall expreſſe ſuch diſdain and indignation againſt their Idols, that they ſhall take not only thoſe made of trees and ſtones, but even their moſt pretious and coſtly Idols, thoſe that were made of ſilver and gold, and caſt them to the moles and to the bats; that is, they ſhall caſt them into ſuch blind holes, and into ſuch dark, filthy, naſty and duſty corners as moles make under ground, and as Bats rouſt in: So when holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe comes to be exalted in the ſoul, then all a mans dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and boſom ſins, which are his Idols of ſilver, and his
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104351:92"/> Idols of gold: theſe are with a holy indignation caſt to the moles and to the bats; they are ſo loathed, abandoned and caſheered, that he deſires they may be for ever buried in oblivion, and never ſee the light more. Idols were <hi>Ephraims</hi> boſom ſin, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.17. Ephraim <hi>is joyned</hi> (or glewed) <hi>to Idols, let him alone;</hi> but when the dew of grace and holineſſe fell upon <hi>Ephraim,</hi> as it did in <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.5, 6, 7. <hi>Then ſaith</hi> Ephraim <hi>what have I any more to do with idols! v.</hi> 8. Now <hi>Ephraim</hi> loaths his Idols as much or more then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he loved them; he now abandons and abominates them, though before he was as cloſely glewed to them, as the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton is glewed to his <hi>Dalelah,</hi> or as the Enchanter is glewed to the Devil, from whom by no means he is able to ſtir. <hi>Ephraim</hi> becoming holy, cryes out, <hi>What have I any more to do with Idols?</hi> O I have had to do with them too long and too much already! O how doth my ſoul new riſe againſt them! how do I deteſt and abhor them! ſurely I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have more to do with them. But now unholy hearts are very favourable to boſome ſins; they ſay of them as <hi>Lot</hi> of <hi>Zoar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 19.20.</note>

An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy heart is as fond of his boſom ſins, as <hi>Herod</hi> was of his <hi>Herodias;</hi> or a <hi>Demetrius</hi> was of his <hi>Diana;</hi> or as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aman</hi> was of the Idol <hi>Rimmon,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Matthew 6.</note> Boſom ſins have at leaſt a ſeeming ſweetneſſe in them: and therefore an unholy heart will not eaſily let them go. Let God frown or ſmile, ſtroke or ſtrike, lift up or caſt down, promiſe or threaten, yet he will hide and hold faſt his darling ſins:<note place="margin">Job 20.12, 13.</note> let God wound his conſcience, blow upon his eſtate, leave a blot upon his name, crack his credit, afflict his body, write death upon his relations, and be a terror to his ſoul, yet will he not let go his boſom luſts.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:104351:92"/> he will rather let God go, and Chriſt go, and grace go, and heaven go, all go, then he will let ſome pleaſurable, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable luſts go. An unholy heart may ſigh over thoſe ſins, and make war upon thoſe ſins, that war againſt his honours, profits or pleaſures, and yet at the ſame time make truce with thoſe that are as right hands and right eyes; an unholy perſon may ſet his ſword at the breaſts of ſome ſins, and yet at the ſame time his heart may be ſecretly courting of his boſom ſins. But now an holy heart riſes moſt againſt the <hi>Dalilah</hi> in his boſom, againſt the <hi>Benjamin,</hi> the ſon, the ſin of his right hand. And thus you ſee how an holy heart hates and diſdains all ſins; he abhors ſmall ſins as well as great, ſecret ſins as well as open, and boſom ſins as well as others that have not that acquaintance and acceptance with the ſoul. Real holineſs will never mix nor mingle it ſelf with any ſin, it will never incorporate with any corruption: Wine and water will eaſily mix, ſo the wine of gifts and the water of ſin, the wine of civility and the water of vanity, the wine of morality and the water of impiety will eaſily mix, but oyl and water will not mix, they will not incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate; ſo the oyl of grace, the oyl of holineſs, will not mix; it will not incorporate with ſin; the oyl of holineſs will be uppermoſt. Mark natural and acquired habits and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, as a pregnant wit, an eloquent tongue, a ſtrong brain, an iron memory, a learned head, all theſe with ſome high ſpeculations of holineſs, and ſome profeſſion of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſome commendations of holineſs, and ſome vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible actings of holineſs, are conſiſtent with the love of luſts, with the dominion of ſin, witneſs the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Judas, Demas</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus;</hi> but the real infuſed habits of true grace and holineſs, will never admit of the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any ſin, whether great or little, whether ſecret or open.

A holy perſon looks upon his ſins as the crucifiers of his Saviour, and ſo they affect him; he looks upon his ſins as the great incendaries, make-bates, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſt between God and his ſoul, and ſo they afflict him; he looks upon his fins as ſo many reproaches to his God, ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes to his profeſſion, and wounds to his credit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſo they grieve and trouble him; he looks upon his ſins as thoſe that make many a righteous ſoul (beſides his own) ſad, whom God would not have ſadded; and that opens many a ſinful mouth that God would have ſtopped,<note place="margin">Ezek. 13.22.</note> and that ſtrengthens many a wicked heart, that God would not have ſtrengthened; and ſo they fetch many a ſigh from his heart, and many a tear from his eyes. When a holy man ſins, he looks upwards, and there he ſees God frowning; he looks downwards, and there he ſees Satan inſulting; he looks within himſelf, and there he finds his conſcience either a bleeding, raging, or accuſing; he looks without him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and there he finds gracious men lamenting and mourning; and graceleſs men deriding and mocking; the ſenſe of which doth ſorely and ſadly afflict a gracious ſoul.

Look as fire will aſſimilate and turn every thing that comes near it into its own nature; ſo will a holy heart labour to make all that comes near him like himſelf.

A heart that is truly holy, will labour by prayers, reproofs, tears, exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, counſel, and commands, to make others like himſelf: He knows that there is no love, no wiſdom, no care, no pains (next to that which he takes with his own heart) to that which is laid out to make unholy hearts holy.

There is a ſilver vein of ſanctity that runs through all his worldly concernments. If you look upon him in his eating and drinking; you ſhall find him holy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. If you look upon him in his buying and ſelling, in his paying and receiving, you ſhall find him holy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23.18. <hi>And her Merchandiſe and her hire ſhall be holineſs to the Lord.</hi> Before <hi>Tyres</hi> converſion ſhe laboured to inrich her ſelf by hook and by crook: all was fiſh that came to <hi>Tyres</hi> net. <hi>Tyre</hi> could ſay any thing, or do any thing, or be any thing for gain. Oh, but when <hi>Tyre</hi> is converted and ſanctified, then all her merchandiſe and hire, then all her gettings and earnings ſhall be holineſs to the Lord. <hi>Tyre</hi> now ſhall write holineſſe upon all her wares and commodities: <hi>Tyre</hi> ſhall buy nothing, nor ſell nothing, nor exchange nothing, but there ſhall be holineſſe written upon it. And <hi>Tyre</hi> ſhall be as well holy in uſing and improving of her merchandiſe and hire, as ſhe hath been holy in the getting of them; for ſo it follows in the ſame verſe, <hi>It ſhall not be treaſured nor laid up: for her merchandiſe ſhall be for them that dwell before the Lord, to eat ſufficiently, and for durable clothing. Tyre</hi> before her converſion hoorded up riches; and laid up her merchandiſe to ſpend upon her luſts; to ſpend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her pride, and wantonneſſe, and luxuriouſneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now being converted ſhe uſes and improves what ſhe hath in the Service of the Lord, and for the comfort, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and relief of the poor and needy.

If you look upon a holy man going to war, then you ſhall find holineſſe written upon the bridles of his horſes, Zach. 14.20, 21. <hi>In that day ſhall there be upon the bridles</hi> (or bells) <hi>of the horſes holineſs unto the Lord. Yea, every Pot in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and in</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall be holineſs unto the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Here is holineſſe written upon the bridles of the horſes they ride on, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:104351:99"/> holineſſe written upon the cups and pots they drink in: a holy heart will be holy in the uſe of the meaneſt things; that are for common uſe. Every piece of his civility ſhall ſavour of ſanctity, and in all the parts of his common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation you ſhall be able to diſcern ſomething of the power of religion, Job 5.24. <hi>And thou ſhalt viſit thy habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and ſhalt not ſin.</hi> Thou ſhalt be holy in thy commerce, and holy in thy converſe; holineſſe ſhall be written upon thy dealings with thy ſervants, and holineſſe ſhall be written upon thy carriages towards thy children, and holineſſe ſhall be written upon all thy behaviours towards thy friends. What ever thou putteſt thy hand to in thy habitation, ſhall have holineſſe written upon it: thou ſhalt make a <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder of all thy earthly enjoyments, all the comforts that be in thy habitation, ſhall be as ſo many bright morning ſtars to lead thee on in a way of holineſſe, and to lead thee up to a holy God. Look upon a holy man in his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and you ſhall find him holy: Look upon him in the uſe of the creatures, and you ſhall find him holy: Look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in his recreations, and you ſhall find him holy. The habitual frame and bent of his heart is to be holy in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry earthly thing that he puts his hand unto. A ſpirit of holineſſe runs and ſhines in all the common actions of his life. But now look upon thoſe who have only the ſhews and appearances of holineſſe, and you ſhall find that they have but a common ſpirit in common things; take them out of their duties, and you ſhall find them in a courſe to be earthly in the uſe of earthly things, and carnal in the uſe of carnal things, and worldly in the uſe of worldly things. All their religion, all their holineſſe lyes in a few duties; take them out of theſe, and you ſhall find them as carnal, as vain, as fooliſh, as filthy and as frothy, as light and as ſlight as thoſe that have not ſo much as a cloak of holineſſe upon them. But he that is really holy, will be holy as well out of duties, as in duties: If you look narrowly upon him in all his worldly concernments, you ſhall find ſome footſteps of the aw, fear, dread, authority and glory of God upon his ſpirit. Look as an unholy heart is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:104351:100"/> in ſpiritual things, and earthly in heavenly things, and unholy in holy things, ſo a man that is truly holy, he is as well holy in the ordinary affairs and actions of this life, as he is holy in any of the exerciſes of Religion. But,</p>

                     <hi>Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldneſſe in the day of judgement, becauſe as he is, ſo are we in this world;</hi> there is no grace in Chriſt, which is not in ſome degree formed in a holy heart: and therefore the work of grace and holineſſe is called a forming of Chriſt in the ſoul,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. Holy hearts have the very prints, ſtamps and impreſſions of the graces of Jeſus Chriſt upon them, 1 John 16. <hi>Of his fulneſſe we have all received grace for grace.</hi> Look as face anſwers to face, ſo the graces that are in real Chriſtians, anſwer to the graces that are in Jeſus; there is ſuch love as anſwers to the love of Chriſt; and ſuch lowlineſſe as anſwers to the lowlineſſe of Chriſt, and ſuch heavenly mindedneſſe as anſwers to the heavenly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe of Chriſt; and ſuch meekneſſe as anſwers to the meekneſſe of Chriſt; and ſuch patience as anſwers to the patience of Chriſt; and ſuch faith as anſwers to the faith of Chriſt; and ſuch zeal as anſwers to the zeal of Chriſt; and ſuch fear as anſwers to the fear of Chriſt, in truth and reality, though not in degree and quantity. Look, as in generation, the child receives member for member; or as the paper from the Preſſe, letter for letter; or the glaſſe from the face, image for image; or as the wax from the ſeal, ſtamp for ſtamp; ſo holy hearts receive from Chriſt grace for grace. Look as wine in the bottle is conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that in the Butt, and as water in the Ciſtern is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to that in the river; and as light in the Air is conformable to that in the Sun; and as milk in the ſawcer is conformable to milk in the breaſts; and as money in the pocket is conformable to money in the bagg. So the graces that are in a holy Chriſtian are conformable to the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:104351:100"/> graces that are in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17, 18. To be a Philoſopher (ſaith <hi>Plato</hi>) is to know God, to be in love with God, and to imitate God. So ſay I, to be a holy perſon, is to know a holy Chriſt, to be in love with a holy Chriſt, and to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the vertues of a holy Chriſt. It was the height of <hi>Caeſars</hi> glory, to walk in the ſteps of <hi>Alexander;</hi> And of <hi>Selymus</hi> (a Turkiſh Emperour) to walk in the ſteps of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> And of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> to walk in the ſteps of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiades:</hi> ſo it is the height of a Chriſtians glory, to tread in the vertuous ſteps of his deareſt Lord.

Look as the holy Prophet did lay his mouth to the <hi>Shunamites</hi> childs mouth,<note place="margin">2 Kings 4.34.</note> and his eyes to his eyes, and his hands to his hands: So a holy Chriſtian layes his mouth to the mouth of Chriſt, and his eys to the eyes of Chriſt, and his hands to the hands of Chriſt, and his breaſts to the breaſts of Chriſt, and his heart to the heart of Chriſt: that is,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.9.</note> he doth in all things labour to reſemble Chriſt, to be like to Chriſt; eſpecially in thoſe holy vertues which were moſt ſhining in the heart and life of Chriſt. Now certainly, they are far from being holy, who count it a crime to be vertuous: and ſo are they who walk directly contrary to Jeſus Chriſt: he was holy, but they are prophane; he was humble, but they are proud; he was heavenly, but they are earthly; he was ſpiritual, but they are carnal; he was zealous, but they are luke-warm; he was meek, but they are contentions; he was charitable, but they are covetous; he was courteous, but they are malitious.

It was a great grief to him ro ſee others a grieving his God. So Jer. 9.1, 2, 3. <hi>O that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night! Oh that I had in the wilderneſſe a lodging place of wayfaring men, that I might leave my people, and go from them.</hi> But why doth the holy Prophet thus take on? why doth he thus lament? why doth he wiſh himſelf turned into waters, and into a fountain of tears? why doth he prefer a habitation amongſt the wild beaſts, before his habitation among his own people? Why, the cauſe you have in the following words, <hi>for they be all Adulterers, an Aſſembly of treacherous men; And they bend their tongues like their bow, for lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> So Ezek. 9.4. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto him, Go through the midſt of the City, through the midſt of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and ſet a mark upon the foreheads of the men that ſigh, and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midſt thereof.</hi> There were holy hearts in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that did ſigh and cry, and cry and ſigh for the wickedneſſe of the times; the abominations of the times did lye in ſuch full weight upon them, that they did fetch many a ſigh from their hearts, and many a tear from their eyes. Holy hearts are able to tell you many ſad ſtories of the groans, griefs and gripes, that other mens ſins hath coſt them. When moſt were a ſinning, Gods marked ones were a mourning; when others were with a high hand a curſing, blaſpheming, and a rebelling, Gods marked ones were deeply ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; they mourned cordially, they ſighed greatly, they grieved wonderfully, they groaned lamentably, and that not for ſome, but for all, for all Court ſins, and Church ſins, and City ſins, and family ſins.

Oh their wickedneſſe did torment and wrack his righteous ſoul, he could not ſee, nor hear of their wickedneſſe, but his ſoul was as upon a wrack. <hi>Pambus</hi> in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory wept when he ſaw an Harlot take ſo much pains to deck and dreſſe her ſelf in curious and coſtly apparrel, and all to entertain a wanton lover, and ſo to make work for hell. Oh it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but grieve a gracious ſoul to ſee what pains poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners take to go to hell! A holy heart looks upon other mens ſins as great diſhonours done to his Father, his King; And therefore he cannot but cry out with <hi>Croeſus</hi> his Son (who though he was born dumb, yet ſeeing ſome going about to kill his Father, his tongue-ſtrings unlooſed, and he cried out) <hi>O kill not King</hi> Croeſus, <hi>kill not my Father.</hi> Oh kill not my God, and my King! Oh kill not, Oh diſhonour not my dear Father, and Saviour, ſaith a holy heart. Such is the love, and high reſpects that holy hearts bear to their heavenly Father, that they cannot but grieve, and mourn, and cry out when they ſee others to act Treaſon againſt the Crown and dignity of heaven. <hi>Elijah</hi> had rather dye then to ſee <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezebel</hi> to caſt contempt and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon his God.</p>

No ſaith he, ver. 25. <hi>With the mind I my ſelf ſerve the Law of God:</hi> Holy <hi>Paul</hi> delights in the Law as holy, and ſerves the Law as holy, juſt, and good.<note place="margin">Theſe ſeveral Titles, Law, Statutes, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, Iudgements, are uſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly for the whole word of God, commonly diſtinguiſhed into Law and Goſpel.</note> A holy heart is taken with the word for its ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality, divinity and purity. So in Pſalm 19.8, 9, 10. <hi>The Statutes of the Lord are right, rejoycing the heart: the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Lord is pure enlightning the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean,</hi> (that is, the Doctrine that teacheth the true fear of God) <hi>enduring for ever: the judgements of the Lord are true and righteous altogether; More to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired are they then gold, yea, then much fine gold: Sweeter alſo then honey, and the hony comb:</hi> or as the Hebrew hath it, Sweeter then the dropping of hony-combs. The whole word of God as it is a pure word, a clean word; ſo it rejoyces a holy heart; and ſo it is ſweeter then the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry droppings of honey-combs. It is more ſweet then thoſe drops which drop immediately and naturally without any force or art, which is counted the pureſt and the ſweeteſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. There is no profit nor pleaſure to that which the purity of the word yields to a holy heart. But now unholy hearts they are affected with the word as it is dreſt up with fine high notions (which are but myſterious nothings) they are taken with the word, as it is cloathed with Arts,<note place="margin">In great Fairs and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, the Ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and the Ballad-ſinger who ſell toyes and trifles, have moſt Children and fools hanging upon them; but they that are wiſe and prudent attend thoſe ſhops where there is beſt &amp; richeſt commodities, you know how to apply it.</note> Parts and Elegancy of phraſe they are pleaſed with the word; as it is apparelled with a ſpruſe wit, or with ſilken Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or with ſome delicate Elocution. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that the delight which he took before his converſion in St. <hi>Ambroſes</hi> Sermons, was more for the eloquence of the words, then the ſubſtance of the matter; ſo many are taken more with the wit, elocution, action, high notions, and far fetch expreſſions that be in a Sermon, then they are taken with the ſpirituality, divinity, weight, and holy worth that is in a Sermon; theſe are like thoſe children, who are more taken with the fine flowers that are ſtrewd about the diſh, then they are with the meat that is in the diſh; and that are more taken with the red weeds, and blew bottles that grow in the field, then they are with the good corn that grows there. But now as the prudent Farmer is taken
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:104351:104"/> more with a few handfulls of ſound corn, then he is with all the gay weeds that be in the field. So a holy heart is more taken with a few ſound truths in a Sermon, then he is taken with all the ſtrong lines, and high ſtrains, and flouriſhes of wit with which a Sermon may be deckt up. Some are taken with the word as the profeſſion of it brings in cuſtomers into their ſhops, and keeps up their credits in the world. Others are taken with the word as it ſeems to tickle their ears, and pleaſe their fancies. Some are affected with Sermons becauſe of the elegancy of the ſtyle, delicacy of the words, ſmoothneſſe of the language, and gracefulneſſe of the delivery. And theſe deal by Sermons as many men do by their Noſegays, that are made up of many pickt (ſweet) flowers, who after they have ſmelt to them a while, caſt them into a corner. So theſe after they have commended a Sermon, after they have applauded a Sermon, they caſt away the Sermon: they ſmell to the Sermon, and ſay it is ſweet, it is ſweet, and preſently they throw it by as a Noſegay that is withered, and of no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe. When a man that is ſick, crazy and unſound, is at a Table that is furniſhed with variety of diſhes, you know he eaſily and readily paſſes over all the moſt whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and nouriſhing diſhes, and falls a pidling and picking here and there upon kickſhaws and puff-paſte, that have little or no ſubſtance in them. So unſound, unholy hearts when God hath prepared his Table, and made a feaſt of fat things for their ſouls in the Miniſtry of his word, they can eaſily and readily paſſe over thoſe ſound, ſolid, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury truths that are prepared for their ſtrength and nouriſhment, and fall a pidling and picking upon ſome new coined phraſes, or ſome quaint expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or ſome Seraphical notions: And no wonder, for they are not ſound within, they are under a great diſtemper. As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> would not be ſatisfied with wholſome diet, but they muſt needs have Quails as picking meat; Well they had them, and whileſt they were at their picking meat, the wrath of God came upon them: the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is as eaſie, as it is dreadfull. But now a holy heart
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:104351:104"/> ſavours the word, and reliſhes the word, and is affected and taken with the word as it is a holy word, a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial word, a pure word, a clean word, and as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets holineſſe, and cheriſhes holineſſe, and increaſes holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and as it works towards the compleating and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of holineſſe.</p>

The Jewiſh Rabbines were wont to ſay, That upon every letter of the Law, there hangs mountains of profitable matter. Gen. 12. and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hap. 22.</note> I further anſwer in the ſecond place; He that loves the Word, and that is affected and taken with the Word, as it is a holy Word, he loves the whole Word of God, and he is affected and taken with one part of the Word as well as another; every Law of God is a holy Law, and every Statute is a holy Statute, and every command is a holy command, and every promiſe is a holy promiſe, and every threatning is an holy threatning, and every exhortation is a holy exhortation; and therefore he that loves any part of the Word as a holy Word, he cannot but love every part of the Word, becauſe every part of the Word is holy. And indeed he loves no part of the Word as holy, who loves not every part of the Word as ſuch. Every chapter in the book of God is a holy chapter, and every verſe is a holy verſe, and every line in that book is a holy line, and every word in every line is a holy word; he that loves a chapter as it is a holy chapter, he loves every verſe in that chapter as a holy verſe; and he that loves every verſe as a holy verſe, he loves every line as a holy line; and he that loves every line as a holy line, he loves every word in every line as a holy word: Upon eaſie commands he reads holineſs, and upon difficult commands he reads holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; upon comfortable commands he reads holineſs, and upon coſtly commands he reads holineſs, and upon danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous commands he reads holineſs, and therefore he loves all, and cloſes with all, and endeavours a conformity to all. A holy heart dares neither to diſpute with that word, nor make light of that word, where he reads holineſs engraven
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:104351:105"/> upon it; to a holy heart, there is no command of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt or unreaſonable; but now an unholy heart, though it may for ſome worldly advantages court and cry up ſome parts of the word, yet it is ready with <hi>Judas,</hi> to betray and crucifie other parts of the word. The whole Scripture is but one intire love-letter, diſpatcht from the Lord Chriſt to his beloved Spouſe on earth, and this letter is written all in golden letters, and therefore a holy heart cannot but be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and affected with every line in this letter; in this love-letter there is ſo much to be read of the love of Chriſt, the heart of Chriſt, the kindneſs of Chriſt, the grace of Chriſt, and the glory of Chriſt, that a holy heart cannot but be affected and taken with it. The whole word of God is a field, and Chriſt is the treaſure that is hid in that field; it is a ring of gold, and Chriſt is the pearl in that ring, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a holy heart cannot but be taken with the whole Word of God. <hi>Luther</hi> was wont to ſay, that he would not take all the world for one leaf of the Bible. And Rabbie <hi>Chija</hi> in the <hi>Jeruſalem Talmud</hi> ſays, that in his account all the world is not of equal value with one word out of the Law.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, A man that is affected and taken with the word as it is a holy word, he is alwayes affected and taken with it; he loves it and takes pleaſure in it, as well in adverſity as in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.59. <hi>Thy Statutes have been my ſongs</hi> (I but where we) <hi>in the houſe of my pilgrimage,</hi> or <hi>pilgrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,</hi>

                     </note> as the Hebrew hath it. When <hi>David</hi> was in his baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by reaſon of <hi>Saul, Abſolom,</hi> and others, now the Word of God was muſick to him, now it was matter of joy and rejoycing to him, his whole life was the life of a Pilgrim and Stranger; now as a Pilgrim he ſojourns here, and anon as a Stranger he ſojourns there; no man could take more pleaſure, joy and contentment in the rareſt and choiceſt muſick, then <hi>David</hi> did in the Word of God, and that not only when he was in his royal Palace, but alſo when he was in the houſe of his Pilgrimage; he that loves the Word, and that delights in the Word for its holineſs and purity,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.67, 69, 70, 72.</note> he will love it and delight in it, in health and ſickneſs, in ſtrength
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:104351:105"/> and weakneſs, in honour and diſgrace, in wealth and want, in life and in death. The holineſs of the Word is a laſting holineſs, and ſo will every mans affections be towards it, who affects it, and is taken with it for its holineſs and pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Some there be that cry up the Word, and that ſeem to be much affected, delighted, and raviſhed with the Word, (as <hi>Herod, Ezekiels</hi> hearers,<note place="margin">Ezek. 33.30, 31, 32, 33. Mar. 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> and the ſtony ground was) whileſt the Word is either a cheap Word to them, or a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and pleaſing Word to them, or whileſt it is courted and countenanced in the world, or whileſt it is the path to preferment, or a key to enlargement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when the Word gets within them, and diſcovers their own ſinfulneſs and wretchedneſs to them, when it ſhews them how Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and gracel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſs, and lifeleſs, and helpleſs, and hopeleſs they are; when it diſcovers how far they are from heaven, and how near they are to hell. O!<note place="margin">Ier. 44.15, 29.</note> then their hearts begin to riſe againſt it, and to cry out, Away with it, it was never good dayes ſince we have had ſo much preaching and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Or when the Word comes to be ſcorned, ſlighted, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced, oppoſed or perſecuted, oh! then they turn their backs upon it, and quickly grow weary of it. As the Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians in <hi>Strabo</hi> delighted themſelves with the muſick of an excellent Harper till they heard the market bell ring, &amp; then they run all away ſave a deaf old man, that could take but little delight in the Harpers ditties. So let theſe men but hear the bell of luſt, or the bell of profit, or the bell of pleaſure, or the bell of applauſe, or the bell of honour, or the bell of errour, or the bell of ſuperſtition ſound in their ears, and preſently they will run from the ſweet mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick of the Word, to follow after any of theſe bells: But now a man that loves the Word, and that is affected and taken with the Word as it is a holy Word, no bell can ring him from the Word, no diſgrace, no affliction, no oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no perſecution can take him off from affecting the Word, and from taking pleaſure in the Word: The cauſe of his love is abiding and laſting, and therefore his love cannot but be laſting and continuing. Not but that a holy heart may ſometimes be more affected and taken with the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:104351:106"/> Word, then at other times. As firſt, when a man enjoyes much communion with God in the Word. Or 2. when God ſpeaks much peace and comfort to the ſoul by the Word. Or 3. when God aſſures a man more clearly and fully of the goodneſs and happineſs of his condition by the Word. Or 4. when God lets in very much quietneſs, or quickneſs, or ſweetneſs, or ſeriouſneſs, or ſpiritualneſs into a mans ſpirit by the Word. Oh then a man may more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be affected and taken with the Word. But now though a holy Chriſtian is not at all times in the ſame degree and meaſure taken with the Word, yet take ſuch a Chriſtian when he is at worſt, and you ſhall find two things in him. 1. You ſhall find in him a holy love to the Word. And 2. you ſhall find in him a real love to holy Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, He that loves the Word, and that is affected and taken with the Word as it is a holy Word, he is moſt affected and taken with thoſe parts of the Word that do moſt incite to holineſs, that do moſt promote holineſs, and that do moſt provoke to holineſs. As 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15.16. <hi>But as he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of converſation; becauſe it is written, Be ye holy, for I am holy.</hi> (I ſhall give you light into theſe words, when I come to open the holineſs of God to you.<note place="margin">Ad ſimilitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, non aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatem. <hi>Calv.</hi>

Certainly the more any man is affected and taken with the holineſs of the Word, the more highly they will honour and prize the holy and faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers of the Word: Holy men know that their place is honourable, their calling honourable, and their work ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and therefore they cannot but honour them. Holy men know that if they do not honour them, they diſhonour him whoſe Embaſſadors they are. Holy men know that Chriſt takes all the affronts that are put upon them,<note place="margin">Luke 10.16. Mat. 22.4, 8. chap. 21.33, 44. and chap. 23.37, 38, 39. 2 Chron. 36.14, 22. 2 Sam. 10.1, 7. compared with chap. 12. ver. 31.</note> as put upon himſelf, and will accordingly revenge them, as you may ſee by comparing the Scriptures in the margin toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Embaſſadors are inviolable by the Law of Nations. <hi>David</hi> never played any ſuch harſh part, as he did to the Ammonites that deſpitefully uſed his Embaſſadors that he ſent unto them, when they ſhaved off one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have read that <hi>Rome</hi> was deſtroyed to the ground for ſome abuſes that were offered to an Embaſſador that was ſent unto it. And the Romans ſacked the famous City of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:104351:108"/> razed it to the ground, for a little diſcourteſie that they offered to their Embaſſadors. No wonder then if God deal ſo ſeverely with thoſe that ſlight his Embaſſadors, who come with meſſages of grace and favour from the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and whoſe great work is to make a firm, an everlaſting peace between God and ſinners ſouls, and that all differences between God and them may be for ever decided, and a free trade to heaven fully opened and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. As for ſuch as ſlight, ſcorn and deſpiſe the holy and faithfull diſpenſers of the word, I think they are as far from real holineſſe, as hell is from true happineſſe. And ſo doubtleſſe are they that grumble at the expence of a penny for the maintenance of that divine Candle that waſteth it ſelf to give light to them:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.14, 15, 16.</note> that will rather die to ſave charges, then ſpend a little money to ſave their lives, yea, their ſouls.</p>
                  <p>In the fourteenth place, A man that is really holy; will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> be holy among the unholy; he will retain and keep his holineſſe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.112. Pſal. 106.3. 1 Joh. 3.9, 10.</note> let the times be never ſo unholy. Principles of grace and holineſſe are laſting, they are not like the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloud, nor the early dew. Holy <hi>Abraham</hi> was righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in <hi>Caldea;</hi> holy <hi>Lot</hi> was juſt in <hi>Sodom;</hi> holy <hi>Job</hi> was upright in the land of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zz,</hi> which was a place of much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſſe and ſuperſtition: Holy <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and zealous in <hi>Damaſco:</hi> And ſo was holy <hi>Daniel</hi> in <hi>Babylon.</hi> The ſeveral generations wherein theſe holy men lived, were wholly devoted to wickedneſſe and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and yet theſe precious ſouls had wholly devoted themſelves to godlineſſe. And of the ſame ſpirit, mind and mettal was holy <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 119.20. <hi>My ſoul breaketh for the longing it hath to thy judgements at all times.</hi> Let the times be never ſo dangerous, licentious, ſuperſtitious, or erroneous, yet <hi>Davids</hi> heart was ſtrongly carried forth to Gods judgements; that is, to his word: for under this title <hi>Judgements,</hi> you are to underſtand the whole word of God. And ſo there were ſome in <hi>Sardis</hi> that were of the ſame ſpirit (with the Worthies above mentioned) Rev. 3.4. <hi>Thou haſt a few names even in</hi> Sardis, <hi>which have not defiled their garments,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 14.4, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>and they ſhall walk with me in white:
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:104351:108"/> for they are worthy.</hi> In polluting times, pure hearts will keep themſelves pure. A holy heart will keep himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, even in defiling times; when others are beſmeared all over, he will keep his garments white and clean. Let the times never ſo often turn, you ſhall find that he that is really holy, will be holy under every turn: no turns ſhall turn him out of a way of holineſſe, <hi>Job</hi> 17.9. <hi>The righteous ſhall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Finis coronat opus.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhall be ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ſtronger.</hi> A man that is really holy, will be holy among the holy, and he will be holy among the unholy. If you look upon him among unholy friends, unholy children, and unholy ſervants, you ſhall find him holy. If you look upon him among unholy neighbours, you ſhall find him holy; and if you look upon him among unholy buyers and ſellers, you ſhall find him holy: If you take him at his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, you ſhall find him holy; if you take him in his ſhop, in his commerce, you ſhall find him holy; if you take him in his family, you ſhall find him holy; if you take him in his Cloſet, you ſhall find him holy; if you take him in his journeyings, you ſhall find him holy; or if you take him in his recreations, you ſhall find him holy. True holineſſe is like that famous Queen <hi>Elizabeth, Semper eadem,</hi> alwayes the ſame. The Philoſophers good man is <hi>(Tetra-gonos)</hi> four ſquare, caſt him where you will, like a Dye, he falls alwayes ſure and ſquare. So caſt a holy man where you will, and into what company you will, yet ſtill he falls ſure and ſquare for holineſſe. True holineſſe is a part of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, it is of ſuch a heavenly complexion, that it will never alter. If the times ſhould be ſo ſad and bad; that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſons ſhould not be able to hold faſt their eſtates, their liberties, their trades, their lives, their religion,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 18.13.</note> yet they will ſtill hold faſt their holineſſe. A holy Chriſtian is like gold; Now caſt gold into the fire, or into the water, caſt it upon the dunghill, or into the pleaſant garden, caſt it among the poor, or among the rich, among the religious, or among the licentious; yet ſtill it is gold, ſtill it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains its purity and excellency; ſo caſt a holy Chriſtian, a golden Chriſtian into what condition you will, and into
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:104351:109"/> what company you will,<note place="margin">Gen. 39.</note> yet ſtill he will retain his purity, his ſanctity; yea, the worſer the times are, the more a holy man ſtudies holineſſe, and prefers holineſſe, and prizes holineſſe, and practiſes holineſſe, that he may keep up the credit of holineſſe, and the credit of a holy God, and the credit of his holy profeſſion in the world. But now ſuch as have only a ſhew of holineſſe, an appearance of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, theſe will be religious among the religious, and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous among the vitious. They will be righteous among the righteous, and licentious among the licentious, they will be as the company is amongſt which they are caſt: with the good they will be good, and with the bad they will be bad; with the zealous they will be zealous, and with the ſuperſtitious they will be ſuperſtitious; and with the lukewarm they will be lukewarm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are for all times and tides, they are for any turn that will ſerve their turn,<note place="margin">Iſa. 9.17.</note> for any mode that will bring pleaſure or profit to them; they are like <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades,</hi> of whom it was ſaid, that he was <hi>(omnium hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum homo)</hi> a man for all times; for he could ſwagger it at <hi>Athens;</hi> and take any pains at <hi>Thebes;</hi> he could live moſt ſparingly at <hi>Lacidaemon,</hi> and bib among the <hi>Thracians,</hi> and hunt among the <hi>Perſians.</hi> So theſe men can accommodate themſelves to the times, and comply with them, what ever they be: with <hi>Proteu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Look as curious and well drawn pictures ſeem to turn their eyes every way, and to ſmile upon every one that looks upon them; ſo theſe can turn with the times, they can look as the times look, and ſmile as the times ſmile; they can ſay with the times, and ſail with the times. Sometimes they can act one part, and ſometimes another part, as the times require: if the times require a large profeſſion, they can make it; if the times require a rigid Spirit againſt ſuch as cannot comply with the times, they can act it: If the times
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:104351:109"/> beſpeak them to leave their religion at the Church door, they can leave it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the times call upon them to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God according to the preſcriptions of men, they can do it. Oh but give me a man that is really holy, and he will be holy though the times ſhould be never ſo unholy; yea, the more licentious the times are, the more gracious he will labour to be.</p>
                  <p>In the fifteenth place, He that is really holy, propounds <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> ordinarily to himſelf holy aims and ends in his actings and undertakings. The glory of God is the mark,<note place="margin">Iohn 7.18. Gen. 41.16. Dan. 2.23. Titus 2.10. 1 Cor. 10. ult. Rev. 12.11.</note> the white that holy men have in their eyes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.7, 8. They live not to themſelves, but they live to him who lives for ever; they live not to their own wills, luſts, greatneſſe and glory in this world; but they live to his glory, whoſe glory is dearer to them then their very lives.

                     <hi>We preach not our ſelves, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord:</hi> that is, in our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we woo not for our ſelves, but for Chriſt. We are no kin to thoſe who ſpeak two words for themſelves, and hardly one for Chriſt. In all our preaching we eye the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt, we deſign the honour and exaltation of Chriſt; Real holineſſe is commonly attended with a ſingle eye; as counterfeit holineſſe is commonly attended with a ſquint eye; ſquint eyd aims, and ſquint eyd ends do uſually wait upon double hearts. Take a holy man in the exerciſe of his gifts and graces for the good of mens ſouls, or take him in the exerciſe of charity for the good of mens bodies, and in both you ſhall find his eye fixt upon the glory of God. Suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that 1 Pet. 4.11. <hi>If any man ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the oracles of God; if any man miniſter, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth, that God in all things may be glorified through Jeſus Chriſt; to whom be praiſe and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion for ever and ever, Amen.</hi> Look as bright ſhining golden veſſels do not retain the beams of the Sun which they receive, but reflect them back again upon the Sun: So thoſe that are really holy, they do return and reflect back again upon the Sun of righteouſneſſe the praiſe and glory of all the gifts, graces and vertues that they have
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:104351:110"/> received from him. The daily language of their Souls, is, <hi>Non nobis Domine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 13.7.</note> 
                     <hi>non nobis Domine. Not unto us Lord, not unto us Lord, but to thy name be all the glory.</hi> Holy men make conſcience of giving men their dues:<note place="margin">1 Chron. 29.10.18.</note> how much more then do they make conſcience of giving God his due.<note place="margin">So in Pſal. 96.7, 8.</note> Now glory is Gods due, and God ſtands upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, then that we give him the glory due unto his name, as you may ſee in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 29.1, 2.

Holy hearts do habitually eye the glory of Chriſt in all things.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.31. <hi>Quicquid agas, propter Deum agas:</hi> was an Eaſtern Apothegm, ſaith <hi>Druſius.</hi>
                     </note> When they eat, they eat to his glory; and when they drink, they drink to his glory; and when they ſleep, they ſleep to his glory; when they buy, they buy for his glory; and when they ſell, they ſell for his glory; and when they give, they give for his glory; and when they recreate themſelves, they recreate themſelves for his glory; ſo when they hear, they hear for his glory; and when they pray, they pray for his glory; and when they faſt, they faſt for his glory; and when they read, they read for his glory; and when they come to the Lords Table, they come to his glory in all natural, moral and religious actions. Holy hearts have an habitual eye to divine glory. Do not miſtake me, I do not ſay that ſuch as are really holy, do actually eye the glory of Chriſt in all their actions: Oh no, this is a happineſſe deſirable on earth, but ſhall never be attained till we come to heaven. By and baſe ends and aims will too often creep into the holieſt hearts, but holy hearts ſigh and groan under them; they complain to God of them, and they cry for Juſtice, Juſtice upon them: And it is the ſtrong and earneſt deſires of their ſouls to be rid of them. But take a holy Chriſtian in his ordinary, uſual and habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al courſe, and ſo he hath holy aims and ends in all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and undertakings. But now ſuch whoſe holineſſe is counterfeit, they never look at divine glory in what they
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:104351:110"/> do; ſometimes their eye is upon their credit,<note place="margin">Mar. 6.5. John 6.26. Zach. 7.5, 6, 7.</note> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their eyes are upon applauſe, ſometimes they have pleaſure in their eyes, and ſometimes they have profit in their eyes, and ſometimes they have preferments in their eyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They will be very godly when they can make a gain of godlineſſe; they will be very holy, when holineſſe is the way to outward happineſſe; but this religious wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe will double damn them at laſt. This is moſt certain, that ſome carnal or worldly conſideration or other, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes acts him who hath not real, principles of holineſſe in him: but he that is really holy makes the glory of God his Center. <hi>Propter te Domine, propter te,</hi> was once, and is ſtill a holy mans Motto.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, Such a man as makes the glory of God his aim, his end, he will do duty when all outward incouragements to duty fail; when the eye of men, the favour of men,<note place="margin">

Though outward incouragements be ſometimes as a ſide wind, or as oil, or as chariot wheels, means to move a Chriſtian to go on more ſweetly, eaſily and comfortably in the wayes of God, yet when this wind ſhall fail, and theſe chariot wheels ſhall be knockt off, a real Chriſtian will hold on his way, <hi>Job</hi> 17.9.</p>

And my ſpeech, and my preaching was not with enticing words of mans wiſdom, but in demonſtration of the Spirit, and of power: That your faith ſhould not ſtand in the wiſdom of men, but in the power of God.</hi> Holy <hi>Paul</hi> handled holy things in ſuch a manner, as much of God, and little (or nothing) of man could be perceived. In religious exerciſes, <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to ſay to humane eloquence, and fleſhly wiſdom, to affected Rhetorick, and flattering Oratory, Stand a far off, come not near; I have now to do with God, and to do with ſouls, and to do with eternity, and therefore what have I to do with you? <hi>Paul</hi> had an eye to divine glory in what he did, and therefore he durſt not tip his tongue, and ſtore his head with aiery noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or with the enticing words of mans wiſdom. Of all
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:104351:111"/> the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">At a feſtival time, when <hi>Bernard</hi> had preached very eloquently, and the people much admired and applauded him, he was much ſadded; the next day he preached a plain and powerfull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon without any Rhetorical dreſſes, at which many curious itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ears were unſatisfied, but himſelf and his meaner capacitated Auditors were much pleaſed and delighted; and being asked the reaſon of it, he returned this anſwer, <hi>Heri Bernardum, hodie Jeſum Chriſtum:</hi> yeſterday I preached <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> but to day Jeſus Chriſt.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> was moſt eminent and excellent in all humane Arts, Parts, and Gifts, and yet in religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes he layes them all by, 1 Cor. 14.18, 19. <hi>I thank my God, I ſpeak with tongues more then you all:</hi> Yet in the Church I had rather ſpeak five words with my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that by my voice I might teach others alſo, then ten thouſand words in an unknown tongue. The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> excelled all other Churches in gifts (I do not ſay in grace) and many among them prided themſelves up in the exerciſe of their gifts and tongues in their Church Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, that ſo they might win the more credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to themſelves of being men of great learning, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and parts; but the holy Apoſtle by his own example labours to win them to decline all vain oſtentation, and to work them to expreſſe themſelves ſo as might be moſt for the information, conviction, edification and ſalvation of their hearers ſouls. Holy <hi>Paul</hi> had much learning, and yet in religious exerciſes he uſed little. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> had leſſe, and yet made ſuch ſhews and flouriſhes of it (even in their religious duties,) as if in their breaſts all the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries in the world had been lockt up. This puts me in mind of what once I have read concerning a <hi>Rabbi</hi> that had but little learning and leſſe modeſty and ingenuity; for he uſurping all the diſcourſe at Table where many were, one much admiring of him, asked one of his friends in private, Whether he did not take ſuch a man for a great Scholer? to whom he anſwered, For ought I know he may be learned; but I never heard learning make ſuch a noiſe. The more learning, the leſſe noiſe; the leſſe learning, the more noiſe men will make. The Sun ſhews leaſt when it is at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; and thoſe waters are moſt deep, that run moſt ſilent: they uſually are men of the greateſt parts, that uſe them leaſt in religious works. Famous Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> was wont to ſay, that ſo much Latine was ſo much fleſh in a Sermon. The gilt upon the Pill may pleaſe the eye, but it profits not the Patient; The paint upon the glaſs may feed the fancy, but the room is rather the darker then the lighter for it. Painted glaſſe in Churches is more glorious, but plain glaſſe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:104351:112"/> is moſt perſpicuous: when men come to Church-work, to Pulpit-work, all plaineſſe muſt be uſed: Starched Oratory may tickle the brain, but its plain Doctrine that informs the judgement, that convinces the conſcience, that bows the will, and that wins the heart. That Sermon hath moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it, that hath moſt plaineſſe in it. And therefore a great Scholer was wont to ſay, <hi>Lord, give me learning enough, that I may preach plain enough.</hi> Silly ignorant people are very apt to dote upon that moſt, and admire that moſt which they underſtand leaſt; But prudent Chriſtians judge of Miniſters not by their lungs, but by their brains: not by their throats, but by their hearts and lives: not by their voices and tones, but by the plainneſſe, ſpiritualneſſe, ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe and uſefulneſſe of their matter: Like <hi>Demoſt hé<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>

Chriſt ſaies, his Spouſes lips are like a thred of ſcarlet; they are red with talking of nothing but a crucified Chriſt; and they are thin like a thred, not ſwelled with other vain diſcourſes. And ver. 10. he tells you, That the lips of his Spouſe drop as the honey-combs (or drop honey-combs) and that honey and milk are under her tongue. You know that <hi>Canaan</hi> was a land that flowed with milk and honey; why the language of the Spouſe was the language of <hi>Canaan;</hi> her lips were ſtill dropping ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſpiritual and heavenly matter, as was as ſweet, pleaſant, profitable, deſireable and delectable to mens ſouls, as ever honey and millk was to mens palates or appetites; and as many were fed and nouriſhed by milk and honey, ſo many were fed and nouriſhed by the holy droppings of her lips; <hi>Pſalm</hi> 37.30. <hi>The mouth of the righteous ſpeaketh wiſdom, and his tongue talketh of judgement.</hi> If the heart be holy, the tongue will be a talking wiſely, fruitfully, feelingly, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately of that which may profit both a mans ſelf and others. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.20. <hi>The tongue of the juſt is as choice ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi>

                     <hi>the heart of the wicked is little worth.</hi> Good mens words are of more worth then wicked mens hearts: and look as choice ſilver is known by its tinkling, ſo holy men are known by their talking. And as choice ſilver giveth a clear and ſweet ſound, ſo the tongue of the juſt ſoundeth ſweetly and pleaſantly in the ears of others. Look as choice ſilver is highly prized and valued among men, ſo is the tongue of the righteous among thoſe that are righteous: And look as choice ſilver allures and draws the hearts of men to a love and liking of it; ſo the tongues of the righteous do allure and draw the hearts of men to a love and liking of vertue and goodneſs. Ver. 21. <hi>The lips of the righteous feed many.</hi> They feed many by their exhortations, inſtructions, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions and counſels: The mouthes of the righteous are like the gates of ſome hoſpitable perſons, where many are fed.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:104351:115"/> The lips of the righteous are a free and well furniſhed table, at which many are fed and nouriſhed with the dainties of heaven to eternal life. Righteous men keep open houſe, they keep free hoſpitality for all comers and goers; and if they have not alwayes bread in their hands, yet they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes grace in their lips to feed many. Though they may be outwardly poor, yet they have a treaſure within to enrich many. The tongue is the inſtrument of a Chriſtians glory, and is ſo intereſted in the quality it expreſſeth, that in the original it is taken for it, <hi>Cavod</hi> ſignifying both glory and the tongue, (by the authority of no leſs Rabbines then <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> and <hi>David</hi>) as thereby intimating that the chiefeſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of man is his tongue. The Primitive Chriſtians talked ſo much and ſo often of high and heavenly things, that the Ethnicks began to ſurmiſe that they affected the Roman Empire, when indeed their ambition was of another, a nobler and a higher nature. But now men that have only a ſhew of godlineſs, they do practically ſay, Our tongues are our own, and who ſhall controul us? Their ſpeech is ſo far from adminiſtring of grace to their hearers, that it admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters uſually either matter of carnal mirth, or of contempt, or of ſcorn, or of ſorrow and mourning; certainly they have no holineſs in their hearts, who have ſo much of hell,<note place="margin">Jam. 1.26, 27. chap. 3.8.12. Matth. 26.73.</note> and the Devil, and luſts in their mouthes. I may ſay to moſt, You are unholy perſons, your ſpeech bewrayes you, your worldlineſs, your prophaneneſs, your curſing, your ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, your lying, your ſlandering, your reviling, your rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, your deriding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth plainly evidence that you have no holineſs, in you. Well, remember this, a tongue that is ſet on fire from hell, is in danger to be ſet on fire in hell. Hell is for that man, and that man is for hell, that hath ſo much of hell in his mouth; the Devil is for that man, and that man is for the Devil, that hath ſo much of the Devil in his mouth; Damnation is for that man, and that man is for damnation, that hath ſo much of damnation in his mouth; the world is for that man, and that man is for the world, that hath ſo much of the world in his mouth. Whatever is in the heart, will break out in the lips; if wickedneſs be in
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:104351:116"/> the heart, it will break out in the lips. Phyſitians ſay that the nature of diſeaſes is as well known by the tongue, as by the pulſe or urine. The ſpiritual diſeaſes that be in the heart, will quickly diſcover themſelves by the tongue. Whereever holineſs is in the heart, it will break forth in the lips; a holy heart and a holy tongue are married together, and it is not in man to put them aſunder; you ſhall ſooner ſeparate the ſoul from the body, then you ſhall ſeparate a holy tongue from an holy heart. And thus I have done with this uſe of examination; the Lord make you wiſe to lay theſe things to heart, that ſo you may know how it is like to go with you in another world.</p>

O Sirs, do not deceive your own ſouls: holineſſe is of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity,<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 1.8, 9, 10.</note> without it you ſhall never ſee the Lord; it is not abſolutely neceſſary that you ſhould be great or rich in the world: but it is abſolutely neceſſary that you ſhould be holy: it is not abſolutely neceſſary that you ſhould enjoy health, ſtrength, friends, liberty, life, but it is abſolutely neceſſary that you ſhould be holy. A man may ſee the Lord without world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proſperity; but he can never ſee the Lord except

Ah Sirs, holineſſe is a flower that grows not in natures garden. Men are not born with holineſſe in their hearts, as they are born with tongues in their mouths: holineſſe is of a divine off-ſpring: it is a pearl of price, that is to be found in no nature but a renewed nature, in no boſome but a ſanctified boſome.

All men are born ſinners, and there is nothing but an infinite power that can make them Saints. All men would be happy, and yet they naturally loath to be holy. By all which you may clearly ſee that food is not more neceſſary for the preſervation of natural

All thoſe notorious ſinners that the Scripture declares, have been ſanctified and made holy, to inſtance only in a few. <hi>Adam</hi> you know was created in an eſtate of innocency,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.26.</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and perfect holineſs; he being made in the image of God, and after the likeneſs and ſimilitude of God; it was agreed upon in the Parliament of heaven, that man ſhould be made glorious in holineſs,<note place="margin">In this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture he ſpeaks plainly of the Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of that knowledge, holineſs, and righteouſneſs that <hi>Adam</hi> ſomtimes had, but loſt it by his fall. Pſal. 8.4, 5, 6. Gen. 2.20.</note> and ſo he was, for he was made after Gods own image. And this the Apoſtle clearly and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evidences in that famous Scripture, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24. That <hi>Adam</hi> was inveſted and endowed with righteouſneſs and holineſs in his firſt glorious eſtate; with righteouſneſs, that he might carry it fairly, juſtly, evenly, and righteouſly towards man; and with holineſs, that he might carry it wiſely, lovingly, reverentially and holily towards God; And that he might take up in God as his chiefeſt good, as in his great All, might be fufficiently made good out of this Scripture laſt cited: but I ſhall not now ſtand upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of <hi>Adams</hi> beauty, authority, dominion, dignity,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:104351:119"/> honour, and glory with which he was adorned, inveſted and crowned in innocency. Let this ſatisfie, that <hi>Adams</hi> firſt eſtate was a ſtate of perfect knowledge, wiſdom, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; it was a perfect ſtate of holineſs, righteouſneſs, and happineſs; there was nothing within him, but what was deſirable and delectable; there was nothing without him, but what was amiable and commendable; nor nothing about him, but what was ſerviceable and comfortable; and yet in the height of all his glory, he falls to Apoſtaſie and open Rebellion againſt God; he takes part with Satan againſt God himſelf; he tranſgreſſes his righteous Law, he affronts his juſtice, he provokes his anger, he ſtirrs up his wrath againſt himſelf and his poſterity. The ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was a voluminous ſin, all kinds of notorious ſins were bound up in it, as backſliding, rebellion, treaſon, pride, unbelief, blaſphemy, contempt of God, unthankfulneſs, theft, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Philoſopher being asked which was the beſt member of the body, anſwered, The tongue; for if it be good, it is the beſt Trumpet of Gods glory; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked again which was the worſt, anſwered, The tongue; for if it be bad, it is the worſt fire-brand of hell. So if any ſhould ask me, Which was the beſt creature of God? I would anſwer, Man in honour before his fall: If you ſhould ask me, Which is the worſt? I muſt anſwer, Man in his fall. <hi>Adam</hi> was once the wonder of all underſtanding, the mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of wiſdom and knowledge, the image of God, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of heaven, the glory of the creation, the worlds great Lord, and the Lords great darling; but being faln, ah how low, how poor, how miſerable, how ſottiſh, how ſenſleſs, how brutiſh, yea how much below the beaſt that periſheth was he! and yet God pardoned, changed, and ſanctified him, and ſtampt his image of holineſs afreſh upon him, when he made a Covenant with him in Chriſt, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 3.</p>

It was the great deſign of Chriſt in the diveſting of himſelf (as it were) of his divine honour, glory, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.6, 7, 8, 15.</note> and in his taking on him the nature of man, to deſtroy Satan, and to ſanctifie the ſouls of men. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11, 14, 15.

The crown of holineſs was faln from our heads, and Chriſt freely and willingly uncrowns himſelf, that once more we might be crowned with holineſs, immortality and glory. Chriſt was reſolved that he would loſe all that was near and dear unto him, but he would recover our loſt holineſs for us. Chriſt knew that heaven had been but a poor purchaſe, had he not purchaſed holineſs for us. As heaven is but a low thing without God, ſo heaven is but a low thing without holineſs. It is holineſs that is the ſparkling Diamond in the Ring of happineſs; a man were better be holy in hell, then unholy in heaven; and therefore Chriſt ventures his All for holineſs. The great deſign of Chriſt in redeeming of ſouls with the choiceſt, the pureſt, the coſtlieſt, the nobleſt blood that ever run in veins,<note place="margin">Luke 1.74, 75.</note> was that they ſhould ſerve him in righteouſneſs and holineſs all the daies of their lives. In a word, Chriſt had never taken ſo great a journey from heaven to earth, but to make men holy; he had never taken upon him the form of a ſervant, but to make us the ſervants of the moſt high God. He had never
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:104351:122"/> lyen in a manger, he had never trod the Wine-preſs of his fathers wrath, but to make you holy; he prayed, he ſweat, he bled, and he hung on the Croſs, and all to make you holy; he was holy in his birth, and holy in his life, and holy in his death, and holy in all his ſufferings, and all to make you holy: The great deſign of Chriſt in all he did, and in all he ſuffered, was to make man holy. And thus you ſee by all theſe Arguments, that holineſs is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider this, that real holineſs is the honour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and the glory of the creature, and therefore the Apoſtle links holineſs and honour together. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.3, 4.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. <hi>ult.</hi> Eph. 5.27.</note>

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:104351:123"/> of that perſon. Why was <hi>Jabez</hi> reputed more honourable then his brethren, but becauſe he was more holy then his brethren! 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4.9, 10. <hi>And</hi> Jabez <hi>was more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then his brethren; And his mother called his name</hi> Jabez, <hi>ſaying, becauſe I bare him with ſorrow.

And God granted him that which he requeſted.</hi> Holineſs is the trueſt and the greateſt nobility and honour in the world. It is very obſervable, that among Turks, Jews, Indians, Perſians, and Papiſts, the ſtricteſt and holieſt among them are moſt highly eſteemed and honoured. <hi>Romanus</hi> the Martyr, who was born of noble parentage, intreated his perſecutors that they would not favour him for his nobility; for it is not (ſaid he) the blood of my anceſtors, but my Chriſtian faith that makes me noble. <hi>David</hi> thought it not ſo happy, nor ſo honourable a thing to be a King in his own houſe, as to be a door-keeper in Gods houſe. <hi>Solomon</hi> did prefer the title of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> (that is, a ſoul reconciled to the Church) before the title of the King of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> Holy <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperour preferred the title of <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum Eccleſiae,</hi> a member of the Church, before that of <hi>Caput imperii,</hi> the head of the Empire, profeſſing that he had rather be a Saint and no King, then a King and no Saint.

And <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> had rather be (<hi>Chriſtianus ruſticus,</hi> then <hi>Ethnicus Alexander</hi>) a Chriſtian clown then a Pagan Emperour. Theſe holy men well knew that holineſs was the top of all their honour and glory. Well ſinners, remember this, that holineſs is the high and ready way to the higheſt honour; and therefore as ever you would be truly honourable, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be truly holy. Great ſwelling titles are but as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Rattles, or as ſo many Fethers in mens caps, without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; he that can be content to live without holineſs, muſt be contented to ſee his honour intombed whileſt he lives.

Many a man hath been the worſe, but where lives that man that hath been ever the better for his worldly honour? A man ſwelled with honour (without holineſs) is like a man in a Dropſie, whoſe bigneſs is his diſeaſe.

Ah ſinners, ſinners, if you will be ambitious, be ambitious of that honour that comes in upon the foot of holineſs, for there is no honour to that honour. The Romans were inſatiable in their deſires after worldly honour, which is but as a blaſt, a ſhadow, a dream. O! how much more inſatiable ſhould you be in

A ſweet, a good natured wife, is as a gold ring upon her husbands finger; a gifted wife is as a gold chain about her husbands neck, but a holy vertuous wife is as a crown upon her husbands head. The holineſſe of the Prince is an honour and an ornament to the people; and the holineſſe of the people is an honour and an ornament to the Prince.

They were as ſo many bright morning Stars, they were as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny riſing Suns in the places where they were bred and born. <hi>Melancthon</hi> was called the Phenix of <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> was the glory of the age wherein he lived. And ſo were many of the antients before them, and many ſince, who have been burning and ſhining lights in the places of their abode. Look as an unholy perſon is a plague and a curſe to the very place he lives in, and haſteneth down wrath and vengeance upon it: as <hi>Bias</hi> the Philoſopher hath long ſince obſerved; for he being at Sea in a great tempeſt, among many prophane debauched fellows, and perceiving them to call upon their gods (as the worſt of men uſually do in ſuch caſes) he comes to them, and deſires them to hold their peace, leſt the gods ſhould take notice that they were in the Ship, and ſo not only themſelves but others alſo ſhould ſuffer for their ſakes. It was the wickedneſſe of the wicked, that brought the ſweeping flood upon the old world; and it was the wickedneſſe and filthyneſſe of the Sodomites, that cauſed God to rain hell out of heaven upon the Cities where they lived: Let men be never ſo honourable, or never ſo potent, or never ſo witty, or never ſo wealthy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet if they are prophane, if they are wicked, they will haſten down the wrath and vengeance of God upon the places of their abode. So a holy perſon is an honour and a bleſſing to the very place he lives in: As you may ſee in <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who were choice and noble bleſſings to the very families where they lived. O Sirs, as ever you would be an honour to your relations, to your Countrey, and to the places of your abode, labour for holineſs.

So <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.3. Iſrael <hi>was holineſs unto the Lord, and the firſt fruits of his increaſe: all that devour him ſhall offend: evil ſhall come upon them ſaith the Lord.</hi> Holineſſe to the Lord, is the mark that God ſets upon all his precious ones. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 4.3. <hi>Know that God hath ſet apart him that is godly for himſelf.</hi> God hath won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully, gloriouſly, marvelouſly, yea miraculouſly ſet apart the pious, the holy, the merciful, the godly man, the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Saint, by ſome mark of diſtinction for himſelf,<note place="margin">The Hebrew word, <hi>Chaſid,</hi> imports as much, Joſh. 2.

Look as <hi>Rahahs</hi> houſe was known by a red thred, and the Ephraimites by their liſping, and <hi>Jehu</hi> by his driving, and <hi>Peter</hi> by his ſpeaking: ſo real Chriſtians are known by their holineſſe. Holineſſe is King Jeſus his Livery, by which all
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:104351:128"/> his ſubjects and ſervants are known and differenced from all other perſons in the world. And in the Primitive times a Chriſtian was known from another man, only by the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his converſation, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> witneſſes. Look as our Lord Jeſus Chriſt by the ſpirit of holineſs raiſing him up from the dead,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.4.</note> was declared to be the Son of God: ſo it is the ſpirit of holineſſe, it is principles of holineſſe, it is the life and practice of holineſſe,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.17, 18.</note> that declares us to be the ſons of God.

A man were better be a beaſt, then to have the mark of the beaſt upon him.</note> Look as the worſhippers of the Beaſt are known by the mark of the Beaſt that is upon them, ſo the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Chriſt, the people of Chriſt, are known by that mark of holineſſe that Chriſt hath ſet upon them. This title, this compellation, Saints, is given fourſcore times to the people of God in Scripture, as if God took a greater delight to have his children known by this badge and livery, then by any other. As for ſuch that have the name of Saints upon them,<note place="margin">The Title of a Saint is but an empty thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holineſs.</note> but nothing of the nature of a Saint in them; that have a name to be holy, and yet are unholy; that have a name to be gracious, and yet are graceleſſe; that have a name to live, and yet are dead; theſe God will in that day unmask, when he ſhall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity. An unholy Saint is a white Devil, he is a monſter among men. Chriſt ſweat, and prayed, and died, and was raiſed to make ſinners Saints, to make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious religious, and the licentious conſcientious; all he did and ſuffered was to ſtamp the ſeal and impreſſe of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe upon them. And therefore as ever you would be owned and honoured by Chriſt another day, look that the holy Spirit ſets the ſeal of holineſſe upon you. If the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe of holineſſe be upon you in the day that the Lord makes up his Jewels, he will declare you to be his before all the world.

Well Sirs, ſhall the Antiquity of holineſſe provoke you to be holy? Many will do much for Antiquity ſake, and why then ſhould not you do much for holineſs ſake? Holineſſe is Gods firſt-born, it is as antient as the antient of daies: The way of holineſſe is gray-headed, and of antienteſt inſtitution; all other waies are but of yeſterday, they are but new waies to the way of holineſs. And O that this might alaram you to look after holineſſe!

What is of greater value among men then riches? and what is more glorious among men then honour? and what is more ſweet among men then life?

The bag of riches, the robe of honour, and life, that is the comfort and ſweet of both, hangs all upon the back of holineſs.<note place="margin">There is no argument to that which is drawn <hi>ab utili.

It is no ſmall pleaſure to a man, to know that others are pleaſed with him. Beautiful objects do not more delight the eyes, then a good report delights the ears. O Sirs, as ever you would obtain a good report, you muſt labour after holineſs. You may obtain a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port without holineſs, but you can never obtain a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port without holineſs. There is no ſuch way to perpetuate your names,<note place="margin">Holy <hi>Abel</hi> hath been dead above this five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, and yet his name is as freſh and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant as a Roſe to this very day. Heb. 11.4.</note> as to labour after holineſs. Holineſs will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balm your names, it will make them immortal. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.6. <hi>The righteous ſhall be in everlaſting remembrance. Prov.</hi> 10.7. <hi>The memory of the juſt is bleſſed, but the name of the wicked ſhall rot.</hi> Wicked men many times out-live their names, but the names of juſt men out-live them. When a holy man dies, he leaves his name as a ſweet and as a laſting ſcent behind him; his fame ſhall live when he is dead. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Hebrew, the words may be read thus, <hi>The memory of the juſt ſhall be for a bleſsing.</hi> The very remembring
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:104351:134"/> of the juſt ſhall bring a bleſſing upon them that remember them. Whileſt the juſt, the holy man lived, he was a bleſſing to thoſe amongſt whom he lived, and when he is dead, his memory is a bleſſing to poſterity. But the name of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſhall not: whileſt a wicked man lives, he laeis his name under diſdain and diſgrace, and when he dies, he leaves it under an odious ſtink. Wickedneſs corrupts not only the heart but the name: And look as wickedneſs makes a mans ſoul ſtink in the noſtrils of God, ſo wickedneſs makes a mans name ſtink in the noſtrils of men. Look as a wicked mans body (when he is dead) ſtinks under ground, ſo his name ſtinks above ground. His very name caſts forth ſo ſtinking a ſavour, that all the perfumes in the world, and all the ſpicery of hell can never ſweeten it. Well, once more remember, that theſe words, <hi>The name of the wicked ſhall rot,</hi> are a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical ſpeech taken from a tree, which though for a time it grows green and flouriſhes, yet at length it grows rotten; ſo though wicked men may flouriſh and be green and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for a time, yet at laſt they ſhall rot, their names ſhall rot on earth, their bodies ſhall rot in the grave, and their ſouls ſhall rot in hell: but the memory of the juſt ſhall be bleſſed. Next to a holy mans ſoul, there is nothing ſo near and dear to him as his name: and this God will ſo perfume, as that the fragrancy of it ſhall laſt for ever. The name of a holy man ſhall be alwayes as an ointment poured forth: but the name of a wicked man ſhall be alwayes as a ſtinking Jakes. O Sirs! what a deal of ſtir do many men make to get a name, to get a name to be wiſe, a name to be knowing,<note place="margin">

O! but his enemies may raiſe up mounts, and ſo get as high as he is; Well, grant that, but yet they ſhall not hurt him; for he is in a place of defence. O! but though he be in a place of defence, yet his defence is not ſo ſtrong, but it may be broken down and deſtroyed. No, not ſo, for his place of defence ſhall be the munitions of rocks; many rocks, and many munitions of rocks, ſhall be the place of his defence, and therefore his defence is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable, and invincible. O! but though his defence be munitions of rocks, yet he may be famiſhed, he may be ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out, for rocks are barren places, and there is no plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſowing upon rocks: No, he ſhall not be ſtarved nor famiſhed out of his ſtrong place of defence; for bread ſhall be given him, God will ſpread a Table for him.

No, not ſo, for his water ſhall be ſure. O! the ſafety and ſecurity of holy men. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Alexander</hi> tells us, that when he came to beſiege the Sogdians, a people who dwelt upon a Rock, (or ſuch as had the munition of Rocks for their defence) they jeered him, and asked him whether his ſouldiers had wings or not? for, ſaid they, except your ſouldiers can fly in the air, we fear you not. Such is the ſafety of Gods holy ones, that they need not to fear: There are no ladders long enough to ſcale their place of defence, nor no Artillery or Engine ſtrong enough to batter down their munitions of Rocks. There is an Apologue how the Dove made moan to her fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low birds of the tyrannie of the Hawk; one counſels her to keep below, but ſaith another, The Hawk can ſtoop for his prey; another adviſed her to ſoar aloft, but ſaith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Hawk can mount as high as ſhe; another wiſhed her to ſhroud her ſelf in the woods, for there ſhe ſhould be ſecure, but ſaith another, alas, there is the Hawks Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the place where he keeps Court; another bids her keep the Town, but ſaith another, that is to become a prey to man; but at laſt one bids her reſt her ſelf in the holes of the Rock, and there ſhe ſhould certainly be ſafe, for violence it ſelf could not ſurprize her there, and there ſhe was ſafe. Dove-like Saints, they have their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of Rocks to fly to, and there they ſhall be ſafe.

As the righteouſneſſe of the righteous will be a royal protection to him, both againſt the day of wrath, and the wrath of the day: So the righteouſneſſe of the righteous will be a royal protection to him, both againſt death, and againſt all the evils of death.

O Sirs, the more holineſſe riſes in a Nation, the more will righteouſneſſe run down as mighty ſtreams, and the more the hearts of the poor and needy will leap and ſing for joy. There is no way to make a Nation happy but by making of it holy. O Sirs! as you are men, as you are Engliſh-men, as you love your Countrey, as you honour your King and Countrey, and as you deſire the peace, proſperity and felicity of your Countrey, labour to be holy. O <hi>England, England,</hi> it is holineſſe that will be a wall of fire about thee, and a glory in the midſt of thee: it is holineſſe that will make thee happy at home, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous abroad.

The Crown of holineſs was ſet upon the heads of Angels at their Creation; thoſe Princes of glory were crowned with holineſs (as it were) in the cradle. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are holy in their praiſes, and holy in their waitings, and holy in their operations, and holy in all their miniſtrations. <hi>Boddin</hi> tells a ſtory of one, who deſired of God the guidance and aſſiſtance of an holy Angel, and accordingly he had ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible manifeſtations of a holy Spirit that aſſiſted him, and followed him to his death; if in company he ſpake any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary words, he was ſure to be advertiſed and reproved for it by a dream in the night; or if he read any book that was not good, the Angel would ſtrike upon the book, to cauſe him to leave reading in it. When that Sorcerer <hi>Balaam</hi> went to curſe the people of God, a holy Angel ſtood in the way, drew his ſword upon him, and juſtled his bones againſt the wall, and all to prevent the execution of his wicked and curſed intentions, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.22.

Chriſtians (ſaith father <hi>Latimer</hi>) are not bound to be the Saints Apes, they are not to imitate them in every thing; where their examples were good, it is good to imitate them; and where they were bad, it is duty to decline them. The faireſt copies that ever were written by Saints, have their blots, their blurs, and their errata's, and therefore it is beſt, it is ſafeſt, it is nobleſt, to ſet the moſt exact, the moſt perfect, and the moſt excellent copy of the Angels before us; who as they excell in ſtrength, ſo they excell in holineſs alſo. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 103.20. <hi>Bleſs the Lord ye his Angels, that excell in ſtrength, that do his Commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his

O Sirs, it is the ſight of God in heaven, wherein mans happineſs and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs doth conſiſt; it is the fruition of God in heaven, that is the life, the honour, the crown and glory of Angels and Saints: Heaven it ſelf would be but a low thing, yea it would be but <hi>magnum nihil,</hi> a great nothing, without the ſight and fruition of God there. Now without holineſſe there is no ſeeing of God, there is no poſſeſſing or enjoying of God, there is no poſſibility of ever obtaining a part or portion in God. Ah friends, without holineſs all is loſt; thy ſoul is loſt, thy Chriſt is loſt, thy God is loſt, thy Crown is loſt, thy Heaven is loſt, thy glory is loſt, and what are all other loſſes to theſe loſſes? <hi>Demorrathus</hi> (of <hi>Corinth</hi>) ſaith, they loſt the chiefeſt part of their lives happineſs, that did not ſee <hi>Alexander</hi> ſit on the throne of <hi>Darius,</hi> but what was their loſs, to that unconceivable and unexpreſſible loſs, that all unholy perſons muſt ſuſtain, who ſhall never ſee the King of Kings in his beauty, who ſhall never behold the Lord on the throne of his glory! Well Sirs, if none of theſe Arguments can prevail with you to labour after holineſs, I muſt conclude that divine Juſtice hath hardened you, and that Satan hath blinded you, and that your luſts have beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you, and that this world hath bewitched you, and that it had been ten thouſand thouſand times better for you, that you had never been born, then to live without holineſs, and to die without holineſſe, and to be everlaſtingly damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for want of holineſſe. And thus much for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
                  <p>I come now to lay down ſome means and helps to holineſs. Suppoſing that the language of ſome of your ſouls may be this: O, what ſhall we do to be holy! O what courſe, what way, what means muſt we uſe that we may obtain this holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without which we now clearly ſee that we ſhall never come to a fruition of happineſs! Methinks I hear ſome of you crying out, Oh none but holineſs, none but holineſs: As that Martyr once cryed out, <hi>Oh none but Chriſt, none but Chriſt:</hi> Methinks I hear you crying out, O give me holineſs

                  <p>Well then, if you are in good earneſt reſolved to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I would thus adviſe and counſel you: Firſt take heed of ſome things: Secondly, Labour to put in practiſe other things.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Take heed of miſtaking ſome particular Scriptures, as that of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.6. Chap. 18.30, 31, 32. and Chap. 33 11, 14, 16, 19. from theſe and ſuch like Scriptures, many unholy hearts are apt to conclude that they can repent when they pleaſe, and that though they do defer their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, yet it is no ſuch difficult thing to confeſs their ſins at laſt caſt, and to be ſorry for their ſins at laſt caſt, and to forſake their ſins at laſt caſt, and to beg the pardon of their ſins at laſt caſt: And that if they do ſo, God hath given his Word for it, he hath given it under his own hand, that he will pardon their ſins, and ſave their ſouls.

                  <p>Secondly, To repent, is to turn a flint into fleſh, it is to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> turn darkneſs into light, hell into heaven; and is this eaſie?<note place="margin">Ezek. 36.25, 26.

To repent, is to croſs ſinful ſelf, it is to walk contrary to ſinful ſelf, yea it is to revenge a mans ſelf upon himſelf; and is this eaſie? To repent, is to pluck out right eyes, and to cut off right hands, and offer up only <hi>Iſaacs;</hi> and is this eaſie? True repentance is a daily turning of the ſoul further and further from ſin, and a daily turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſoul nearer and nearer to God. It is a repentance not to be repented of; it is a repentance from ſin, as well as a repentance for ſin: Sin hath caſt the ſoul at ſuch a diſtance from God, that though the ſoul be every day a turning nearer and nearer to God, yet it can never (in this life) get ſo near him as once it was, and as in heaven it ſhall be. And now tell me, O ſoul, is this ſuch an eaſie thing to be every day a turning thy back upon ſin, and a turning thy face nearer and nearer to God? ſurely no: True repentance lies in a daily dying to ſin, and in a daily living to him who lives for ever. The very life of repentance, is the repentance of the life; and is this eaſie? But,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, True repentance is a turning, not from ſome ſin, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> but from every ſin. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.30. <hi>Repent and turn your ſelves from all your tranſgreſſions, ſo iniquity ſhall not he your

Every ſin fetcheth blood from the heart of Chriſt, and every ſin is a grief and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Spirit of Chriſt, and therefore the penitent muſt ſet upon crucifying of all: Every ſin is an enemy to a mans peace, and to a mans comfort, and to a mans confidence, and to a mans aſſurance, and to a mans communion with God, and therefore he muſt ſet upon forſaking of all. If ever thou art ſaved, O man, thou muſt repent as well of thy <hi>Achans</hi> as thy <hi>Abſaloms,</hi> of thy <hi>Rimmons</hi> as of thy <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> of thy <hi>Davids</hi> as of thy <hi>Goliahs,</hi> of thy ſecret as well as thy open ſins, of thy loved as well as of thy loathed luſts, of thy babe-tranſgreſſions as well as of thy Giant-like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations: If thy repentance be not univerſal, it will never be effectual: If a ſhip ſpring three leaks, and only two be ſtopt, the third will certainly ſink the ſhip; or if a man hath two dangerous wounds in his body, and takes only order for the cure of one, the other will undoubtedly kill him; or if a man hath two grievous diſeaſes upon him, and will only deal with the Phyſitian for remedies againſt the one, he will without all peradventure periſh by the prevalency of the other. <hi>Herod</hi> turned from many ſins, but not from his <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilah,</hi> his <hi>Herodias,</hi> which was his ruine. <hi>Judas</hi> you know was a Devil in an Angels habit, he ſeemed to be turned from every ſin, but he was not; he was a ſecret thief, he loved the bag, and that golden Devil, Covetouſneſs, choaked him, and hanged him at laſt. <hi>Saul</hi> for a time turned from ſeveral evils, but his ſparing one <hi>Agag,</hi> coſt him his ſoul and his Kingdom at a clap. I have read a ſtory of a devout man, who amongſt other gifts, had the gift of healing, and many perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to him for cure: Among the reſt, one <hi>Chromatius,</hi> who being ſick, ſent for him, and told him of his ſickneſs, and deſired that he might have the benefit of cure, as others had before him: The devout man replyed, I cannot do it till thou haſt beaten all the Images in thy houſe to pieces. O that ſhall be done ſaid <hi>Chromatius;</hi> Here take my keyes, and where you find any images, break them in pieces; which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:104351:147"/> was done; upon this the devout man went to prayer, but no cure was wrought; whereupon the ſick man cryed out, O I am as ſick as ever, O I am very weak and ſick ſtill: It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwiſe, replyed the devout perſon, neither can I help it, for there is doubtleſs one Idol yet in your houſe undiſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that muſt be defaced too: True (ſaith <hi>Chromatius</hi>) it is ſo indeed, it is all of beaten gold, it coſt 200. l. I would fain have ſaved it, but here take my keyes again, you ſhall find it faſt lock't up in my cheſt, break it alſo in pieces; which being done, the devout man prayed, and <hi>Chromatius</hi> was healed. The moral of it is good; the ſin-ſick ſoul muſt break, not ſome, but all its Idols in pieces, before a cure will follow. It muſt deface its golden Idols, its moſt coſtly Idols, its moſt darling Idols; the returning ſinner muſt make head againſt all his ſins, and trample upon all his luſts, or elſe he will die and be undone for ever; and though this be as difficult as it is noble, yet it is no more then what God hath engaged to do, and to ſee done, as you may ſee by comparing <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26, 27. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.21, 22. Now is this an eaſie thing, to turn from every ſin, to loath every ſin, and to abandon every ſin, with a Get you hence, for what have I more to do with you? <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.8. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no. As <hi>Nehemiah</hi> caſt out <hi>Tobiah</hi> and all his houſhold-ſtuff, in <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.6, 7, 8. ſo true repentance, it caſts out Satan and all his retinue; As <hi>Moſes</hi> would not leave ſo much as a hoof behind him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.26. So true repentance will not leave ſo much as a luſt behind; a diſpenſatory conſcience is alwayes an evil conſcience; he that can diſpenſe with one ſin, will, when opportunity preſents, commit any ſin. And as the flood made clean work, it ſwept away all <hi>Noahs</hi> friends, and drowned all his ſervants; ſo the flood of penitent tears makes clean work, it ſweeps away every luſt, it drowns every corruption in reſpect of love and dominion. And as ſome Conquerours would not give ſo much as one of their enemies Quarter; ſo true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance will not give one luſt quarter; it falls heavily upon the bones of every ſin, and nothing but the blood and death of ſin will ſatisfie the penitent ſoul; the true penitent is for the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of every luſt that hath had a hand in crucifying of his deareſt Saviour. It was worthily (and wittily) ſaid by one,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:104351:148"/> that true repentance ſtrips us ſtark naked of all the garments of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> and leaves not ſo much as the ſhirt behind. Well Sirs, remember this, to repent of ſin, and yet to live in ſin, is a contradiction; And if thou repenteſt with a contradiction (ſaith <hi>Tertullian</hi>) God will pardon thee with a contradiction; thou repenteſt and yet continueſt in thy ſin, God will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thee, and yet ſend thee to hell; theres a pardon with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
                  <p>Again fourthly, if repentance be ſuch an eaſie work as you ſuppoſe, I beſeech you tell me, why do many men lie under ſuch horrours and terrours of conſcience as they do, for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, when as repentance would quickly give them eaſe, and turn their hell into a heaven! I was laſt Winter with a young man, who upon his dying-bed for ſeveral hours together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a dreadful agony, lay crying out, I am damn'd, I am damn'd, I am damn'd, I am damn'd! Ah how ſoon would this poor wretch have got out of this hell, if it had been ſo eaſie a thing to have repented, as you imagine it is! and how many, when they have been preſt to repent, have profeſſed, that if they might have a thouſand worlds to repent, they could not repent! And will you ſay that repentance is eaſie? How many have ſought repentance with tears, and would have bought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance with the price of their deareſt blood, but could not obtain it? and will you ſay that repentance is eaſie? O Sirs, is it good to be damn'd? is it good to go to hell? is it good to dwell with a devouring fire, and to live in everlaſting burnings? Is it good to have your habitations amongſt Devils and damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirits? Is it good to be baniſhed the Court of heaven, and to be ſeparated for ever from the glorious preſence of God, and the ſweet enjoyments of Chriſt, and the bleſſed ſociety of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints, and the fruition of all the happineſs that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven affords? O no! O no! O why then do not men prevent all this by repentance, if it be ſuch an eaſie thing to repent! But,</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If repentance be ſuch an eaſie work, why then do your hearts ſo riſe both againſt the Doctrine of repentance, and againſt thoſe that preach it and preſs it? of all words, is not the word of repentance the hardeſt word to read? and of all ſayings and Sermons,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.60.</note> is not that of repentance the hardeſt
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:104351:148"/> to hear and bear? <hi>Luther</hi> confeſſes that before his converſion he met not with a more diſpleaſing word in all the Scripture, nor in all his ſtudy of Divinity, then that word <hi>Repent.</hi> O man! if repentance be ſo eaſie, why doth thy ſpirit rage, and why doth thy heart ſo ſwell and riſe againſt thoſe that preach repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto life? Of all Preachers,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.2. Acts 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> there are none that do ſo diſpleaſe and move thee, that do ſo cut and gall thee, as thoſe that are ſtill a crying out, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand.</hi> Repentance is the vomit of the ſoul; and ah how do ſinners hearts riſe againſt that Phyſick, and thoſe that bring it? Repentance is the bleeding of the ſoul; and ah how do wicked men ſtorm and take on at that hand that lets them blood?<note place="margin">Iſa. 30.10. Jer. 5.30, 31. chap. 14.14. chap. 23.11. to the end.</note> You love thoſe that preach pleaſing things, that tickle your ears, though they never touch your hearts; that pleaſe your fancies, though they never meddle with your conſciences; and one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of mercy you prefer before a thouſand Sermons of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Now certainly if repentance were ſo eaſie to you, the Doctrine of repentance would be more pleaſing to you. For a cloſe, know, that that white Devil who now preſents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to thee as the eaſieſt thing in the world, He will at laſt caſt, to work thee to deſpair, and to cut the throat of thy ſoul, preſent it not only as a hard and difficult work, but as an impoſſible work. O that theſe things may be ſo bleſt unto you, as to preſerve you from being deceived and deluded with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that repentance is eaſie, and ſo by this means keep you from labouring to be holy!</p>
                  <p>Now as to that part of the plea (from the Scriptures for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly cited) <hi>viz.</hi> That hereafter will be time enough to repent; I ſhall thus reply, Certainly the preſent call of God, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of the Spirits motion, and the danger of delay, calls upon thee for preſent repentance; it is a dangerous thing to deal with God, as ill Debtors do by their Creditors; firſt they put them off one week, and then another week, and then a third week, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till at laſt they provoke their Creditors to caſt them into priſon, and to practiſe all ſeverity upon them; they that thus deal with God, ſhall be as ſeverely dealt with by God, as you may ſee in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24. to 32.

If thou doſt thus flatter thy ſelf, it is ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to one but that thou wilt deceive thy ſelf; that God that hath made a promiſe to late repentance, hath made no promiſe of late repentance; &amp; though true repentance is never too late, yet late repentance is ſeldom true: Ah how many millions are now in hell, who have thought, and reſolved, and ſaid, that they would repent hereafter, but that hereafter never came! Thou ſaiſt to morrow, to morrow thou wilt repent, when thou knoweſt not what a to morrow will bring forth. Alas! how many thouſand wayes may death ſurprize thee, before to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row comes? Though there be but one way to come into the world, yet there is a thouſand thouſand wayes to be ſent out of the world. O the diſeaſes, the hazards, the dangers, the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, the deaths, that daily, that hourly attend the life of man! A Jewiſh Rabbin preſſing the practice of repentance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Diſciples, exhorted them to be ſure to repent the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they died; to which one of them replyed, that the day of a mans death was very uncertain; to which the Rabbin made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Repent therefore every day, and then you ſhall be ſure to repent the day before you die. O Sirs, except you do repent to day, you cannot tell that you ſhall repent the day before you die; for who knows to day, but that he may die to morrow?

Doth not common experience tell us, that the longer the Ship leaketh, the harder it is to be emptied; and that the longer the houſe goes to decay, the worſe it is to repair; and that the further the nail is driven, the harder it will be to get out? and ſo certainly the longer any man defers his repentance, the more difficult it will be for him to repent; his heart will every day grow more and more hard, &amp; his will more and more perverſe, and his judgement more and more corrupted, and his affections more and more diſordered, and his conſcience more and more benummed or enraged, and his whole life more and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed and debauched. Friends, do not deceive your ſelves, old age is but a ſad, a ſandy, a tottering and ſinking foundation for you to build your hopes and happineſſe upon; for you to build your everlaſting condition, your eternal making or marring upon. Are the dog dayes of old age, are the trembling hands, the wrinckled face, the dazeled eyes, the ſtinking lungs, the fainting heart, the feeble knees, and the failing leggs, are theſe a ſacrifice worthy of God? is a body full of ſores, aches, and diſeaſes, and a ſoul full of ſin, an offering becoming a God? ſurely no. O what madneſſe, what wickedneſſe is this, to ſerve Satan, your luſts, and this world with full diſhes, and to put off God with ſcraps? to ſerve theſe in the flower, in the prime and primroſe of you days, and to put off God with the dregs of old age? Certainly repentance is rather a work for youth then old age, it is a work rather for ſtrength then weakneſſe; and for health then ſickneſſe. O do not let Satan deceive you, do
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:104351:150"/> not let your own hearts delude you, but fall upon the work of repentance preſently, knowing, that as you have one day more to repent of, ſo you have one day leſſe to repent in. What a piece of vanity is it, that while the Ship is ſound, the tackling ſure, the Pilot well, the Sailers ſtrong, proviſions laid in, and the wind favourable, that the Mariners and paſſengers ſhould lie in the Rode, carding, drinking, diceing, dancing and idling! And when the Ship is leak, the Pilot ſick, the mariners faint, proviſions ſpent, and the winds boiſterous, then to weigh Anchors, and hoiſt up ſail, to make a voyage into a far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey!

                  <p>I have read of a young man, who being admoniſhed of the evil of his way, and courſe, and being preſſed to leave his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, and to break off his ſins by repentance, upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Judgement, Eternity and Death a coming: he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, what do you tell me of theſe things? I warrant you I will do well enough, for when death comes, I will ſpeak but three words, and that will help all, &amp; ſo he went on in his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe: but in the end coming to a Bridge on Horſe-back to go over a deep water, the Horſe ſtumbling, and he labouring to recover his Horſe, could not, but at laſt he let go the Bridle, &amp; gave up himſelf and his Horſe to the waters, and was heard to ſay theſe three words, Devil take all: Here were three words with a witneſſe. And ô that all that think to repent at laſt, with a

The light of thy life may be put out before thou canſt once ſay, <hi>(Miſerere mei Deus)</hi> Lord be mercifull to me a ſinner. Though the Chariot wheels run all the day long very near one another, yet they never overtake one another. O, take heed of delaying thy repentance; for the more thou delayeſt it, the more will thy account be increaſed, thy debt augmented, Satan ſtrengthned, thy body infeebled, thy luſts imboldned, thy ſoul endangered, and all the difficulties of converſion more and more mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied; by delaying of thy repentance, thou goeſt the way to gratifie Satan, to cozen thy ſelf, to loſe the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of grace, and to damn thy ſoul for ever and ever.

Well friends, as ever you would obtain that real holineſs, without which there is no hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, take heed of a Witch, take heed of this world; and to that purpoſe, O that you would always look upon the things of this world, as you will look upon them when you come to dye. O that you would now look upon all the pompe, ſtate, bravery, and glory of the world, as you will look upon it when your ſouls ſhall ſit upon your trembling lips. O with what a diſdainful eye, with what a weaned heart do men look upon thoſe things then? do ſo now, and I dare aſſure you, that though the world may trouble you, yet it ſhall never bewitch you. I have read of a man that lying in a burning Feaver, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that if he had all the world at his diſpoſe, he would give it all for one draught of Beer, at ſo low a rate do men value the world at ſuch a time as that is, if men were ſo wiſe to value
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:104351:153"/> the world at no higher a rate in health, then they do in ſickneſs, in life, then they do at the time of their death, it would never bewitch them, it would never be as a wall of ſeparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween holineſs and them: As ever you would be holy here, and happy hereafter, take heed of this Witch, and believe it to be a Witch before it hath bewitched you, or elſe you may believe it too late.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, If ever you would be holy, then take heed of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring your ſelves with thoſe that are (at leaſt ſuppoſedly) worſe then your ſelves; many there be who by comparing themſelves with thoſe that are bad, very bad, think themſelves to be good, very good, yea to be too good to go to hell, and yet they are not good enough to go to heaven; and many there be who are worſe then others, and yet by comparing themſelves with thoſe they ſuppoſe very bad, they conclude themſelves to be very good; ſuch a one was that proud Phariſee in <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. who thought himſelf a far better man then the poor Publican, and yet he was not half ſo honeſt, nor half ſo juſt, nor half ſo righteous, nor half ſo good as he was; the poor Publican was aſhamed of himſelf, he loathed himſelf, he abaſed himſelf, he judged himſelf, and he condemned himſelf; the poor Publican acknowledged God, he adored God, he dreaded God, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired God, and he juſtified God, in all which he exceeded the proud Phariſee; and yet, O! how ſcornfully does this proud Phariſee look upon him? and how diſdainfully and diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully does he ſpeak of him? And this was the general frame and temper of the Scribes and Phariſees, who thought no mans penny ſo good ſilver as their own, who thought themſelves better then the beſt, when they were the very worſt of the worſt; for Publicans and Harlots believed and repented, and entred into the Kingdom of God before them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.31, 32. And ſo they in that of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. were naught, very naught, yea, ſtark naught, they were the baſeſt among the baſe, they were the vileſt among the vile, they were the moſt rebellious among the rebellious, and the moſt ſuperſtitious among the ſuperſtitious, witneſs <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3, 4. And yet, O! how do they ſtroke themſelves, and bleſs themſelves, and commend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and cry up themſelves, and exalt themſelves as the only
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:104351:153"/> holy ones, <hi>v.</hi> 5. they could deifie themſelves, and yet damne and devilifie others, though they were ſuch monſters as God abhorr'd, <hi>v.</hi> 6. Ah! how many be there who by comparing themſelves with thoſe that are worſe then themſelves, do judge themſelves to be good enough, and holy enough? they are good negative Chriſtians, and they think that's enough to bring them to heaven; they bleſs themſelves that they are no <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals</hi> for drunkenneſs, nor no <hi>Sodomites</hi> for filthineſs, nor no <hi>Hamans</hi> for haughtineſs, nor no <hi>Ammons</hi> for luſtfulneſs, nor none of the old world for idleneſs, nor no <hi>Zacheus's</hi> for cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, nor no <hi>Laodiceans</hi> for lukewarmneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They bleſs themſelves that they are no <hi>Gehazies</hi> for lying, nor no <hi>Shemeies</hi> for curſing, nor no <hi>Joabs</hi> for ſwearing, nor no <hi>Rabſhakehs</hi> for railing, nor no <hi>Doegs</hi> for cruelty, nor no <hi>Judaſes</hi> for treachery, nor no <hi>Demaſes</hi> for Apoſtacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus they cheat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and find out fine ways to delude and damn their own ſouls; they think it grace enough, and holineſs enough, that they have attained to this, <hi>viz.</hi> not to be ſo bad as the worſt, though they fall infinitely ſhort of coming neer unto the beſt. Well ſits, remember this; if you are not ſo great ſinners as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, your horrors, your terrors, your torments, your hell ſhall not be ſo great, nor ſo hot as others, but without holineſs you ſhall be as certainly damn'd as others; and what a cold comfort is this to have a cooler and a lighter hell then others, and yet this is all the comfort that can be handed to unholy hearts. But,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Take heed of flatterers: Ah! how good might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> many men have been, who are yet exceeding bad, had they not ſold their ears to flatterers; flatterers are ſoul-murderers, they are ſoul undoers, they are like vaine Chyrurgions that skin over the wound, but kill the Patient; flattery is the very mother of folly, and the very nurſery of all impiety; flatterers will cry up thoſe for religious, who are onely ſuperſtitious, and thoſe for wiſe men, who are fooliſh, and thoſe for knowing men, who are ignorant, and thoſe for vertuous men, who are vicious, and thoſe for holy men, who at beſt are but civil, and thoſe for happy men, who are (certainly) miſerable; flatterers dare call the proud happy, and bleſs them whom God has curſt, they dare call evil good and good evil, they dare call darkneſs light and light

Ah, how many a man has been kept off from the thoughts of holineſs, and from the ways of holineſs, and from the love and liking of holineſs, by flatterers who have flattered them, that doubtleſs they are in the favour of God, and that certainly God did not make men to damn them, and that without all peradventure they have an intereſt in Chriſt, and that there is no queſtion but that their hearts are as good as the beſt, and that their conditions are good, and their ſouls happy; yea, they are ſo confident of their happineſs that they dare venture a going to hell, if ever ſuch ſhould go to hell whom they fondly flatter; they dare pawn their ſouls and their ſalvation on't, that ſuch ſhall never miſcarry; and by theſe fla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Look as Fowlers ſtrew corn and lay baits, to draw Birds into their nets; or look as Hunters ſpread their nets, that they may take beaſts and prey upon them, or make a prey of them; ſo flatterers they ſpread their nets that they may catch poor ſouls, and either prey upon them, or elſe make make a prey of them. Flattery is the devils inviſible net, and happy is that ſoul that eſcapes it: the flatterers net is worſe then his ſword, for his ſword may be the more eaſily ſeen, feared, and avoided, then his net. Of all arms the flatterers net is the moſt perilous and dangerous, both to the lives, eſtates, and ſouls of men; 'twere ten thouſand times better to trample a flatterer under a mans feet, then for a man to ſuffer his feet to be taken in the flatterers net. A flatterer is a ſore enemy in the habit of a friend, he is a Wolf in Sheeps clothing, he is a devil transformed into an Angel of light; and what puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be too great for ſuch? The ſeverity of many Heathen Princes and Emperors has been very great againſt flatterers; take one inſtance for all,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> commanded one <hi>Turinus</hi> a great flatterer, to be tyed to a ſtake and ſtifled with ſmoak, with an Herald ſtanding by, and proclaiming to all the people, that 'twas but juſt that he that lived by the ſmoak of flattery, ſhould dye by ſmoak. Now what a ſhameful thing is it that ſuch as are called Chriſtians ſhould affect to be flattered, when Heathens have ſo ſeverely puniſhed flatterers. Well ſirs, as ever you would be holy, take heed of flatterers, and take heed of flattery; let <hi>Solomons</hi> counſel be always in your

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, If ever you would be holy, O! then take heed of putting the day of death far from you. Man is a creature na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally prone to look upon death at a diſtance, to look upon death afar off, and to ſay with thoſe in <hi>Ezekiel, Behold they of the houſe of Iſrael, ſay the viſion that he ſeeth is for many days to come,</hi>

Unholy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are very apt to ſay to death as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Get thee from me,</hi>

                     <hi>and let me ſee thy face no more:</hi> When death knocks at the poor mans door, he ſends it to the rich mans gate, and the rich man tranſlates it to the Schollar, and the Scholar poſts it away to the Citizen, and the Citizen to the Courtier, and the Courtier to his Lady, and his Lady to her Maid, &amp; ſo death is poſted away as it were from one to another, every one crying out to death, O let me not ſee thy face, O let me not ſee thy face. 'Twas even a death to Queen <hi>Elizabeth, Sigiſmund</hi> the Emperor, <hi>Lewes</hi> the 11 of <hi>France,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Beauford</hi> and others, to think of death, or to hear of death; and therefore they ſtrictly charged all their ſervants about them, that when they ſaw them ſick, they ſhould never dare to name that bitter word Death in their ears. And <hi>Paſhur</hi> can't caſt his eye upon death, but he is preſently a <hi>Magor Miſſabib,</hi> a terror to himſelf, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.3. And <hi>Saul</hi> though he was a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant King, yet at the news of death he falls on his face, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.20. And ſo <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> though he was a mighty Emperor, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.1, 7. yet a letter to him, from him whom <hi>Bildad</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the King of terrors, <hi>Job</hi> 18.14. Ah how does it amaze, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſh, affright, and terrifie him! and how many are there
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:104351:155"/> who with <hi>Mecaenas</hi> in <hi>Seneca,</hi> had rather live in many diſeaſes then die; and with the moſt famous Heathens, prefer the meaneſt life on earth; above all the hopes they have of another world; like <hi>Achilles</hi> who had rather be a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to a poor country Clown here, then to be a King to all the ſouls departed; or like <hi>Withipoll</hi> a rich and wretched man, who when he was in danger of death, earneſtly deſired that he might live five hundred years,<note place="margin">

And thus you ſee how apt perſons are to ſhrug at death, which is a common lot, and to ſay to it as <hi>Ephraim</hi> did to his Idols, <hi>Get you hence, what have we more to do with you?</hi> but this is and muſt be for a lamentation, that men put off the thoughts of their latter end, to the latter end of their thoughts. Man naturally is a great life-lover, and therefore he will bleed, ſweat, vomit, purge, part with an eſtate, yea with a limb, I limbs, to preſerve his life; like him that cryed out, <hi>O give me any deformity, any torment, any miſery, ſo you ſpare my life.</hi> And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count 'tis that he deſires that ſuch a gueſt as death may not knock at his door; but, Ah, that all ſuch vain men would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that by putting the day of their death far from them, they do but gratifie Satan, ſtrengthen their ſins, provoke the Lord and make the work of faith and holineſs more hard and difficult, and ſo lay a deep foundation for their own eternal deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Well ſirs, remember this, the ſerious thoughts and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of death (if any thing) will work you to break off your ſins, to mend your lives, and to look to the ſalvation of your ſouls; there is nothing that will ſooner work a man to a holy fear of offending God in any thing, and to a holy care of pleaſing God in every thing, then the ſerious meditation of death: Though that text, <hi>Remember thy latter end, and thou ſhalt never do amiſs,</hi> be Apocryphal, yet the truth aſſerted is
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:104351:156"/> Canonical. I have read a ſtory of one that gave a young pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal a Ring with a Deaths-head, on this condition that he ſhould one hour in a day, for ſeven days together, think and meditate upon Death, which accordingly he did, and it bred a great change and alteration in his life and converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. O! man, thou doeſt not know but that the ſerious thoughts of death may work that deſireable thing in thee, <hi>viz.</hi> holineſs, which yet has not been wrought in thee by all the holy counſels, the gracious examples, the fervent prayers, &amp; the ſorrowful tears of thy deareſt friends; thou doeſt not know but that the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meditation of Death, may do thee more good then all the Sermons that ever thou haſt heard, or then all the books that ever thou haſt read, or then all the prayers that ever thou haſt made, or then all the ſighs or groans that ever thou haſt pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out; and why then ſhouldeſt thou put the thoughts of death far from thee? Certainly, as he is a ſinner in grain, that dares look death in the face and yet ſin, that dares cut a purſe when the Judge looks on; ſo he is a monſter rather then a man, that dares look death in the face, and yet ſatisfie himſelf to live without holineſs; that dares look death in the face, and yet ſay I'll drink and be drunk, I'll ſware and ſwagger, I'll roar and whore, I'll cheat and cozen, I'll hate and oppoſe, I'll quarrel and kill, and my hands ſhall be as bloody as my heart, and let death do her worſt; if ſuch a perſon be not in the ready way of being miſerable for ever, I know nothing.</p>

                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, As there is nothing more ſudden then death, ſo there is nothing more ſhort then life,<note place="margin">Job 8.9. Pſal. 102.11. Pſal. 73.20, &amp; 90.5. Job 20.8. ch. 7.7.</note> and why then ſhould you put the day of your death ſo far from you? If you conſider the life of man abſolutely, 'tis but ſhort, 'tis but as a ſpan, a ſhadow, a dream, a bubble, a blaſt, a puff of wind, a pile of duſt, a fad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:104351:157"/> leaf, or a tale that is told, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The life of man is as a dream that vaniſheth when one awaketh, 'tis a wind that goeth away and cometh not again, 'tis as a cloud that is ſoon diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the wind, 'tis as a vapor that appeareth for a time, and then vaniſheth away, 'tis as the graſs that ſoon withereth, 'tis as the flower that ſoon fadeth, 'tis as the candle that every light puffe of wind bloweth out: The life of man is rather made up of days then years, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.12. <hi>So teach us to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our days, that we may apply our hearts to wiſdom. Moſes</hi> does not ſay Lord teach us to number our years, <hi>but Lord teach us to number our dayes;</hi> fallen man is apt to miſreckon, and to compute days for years; and therefore this holy Prophet deſires, that God would teach them this Divine Arithmetick of numbering their days, it being a leſſon that none but a God can teach. So <hi>Job</hi> 14.1, 2. <hi>Man that is born of a woman, is of few days</hi> (or ſhort of dayes) <hi>and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower and is out down: he floeth alſo as a ſhadow and continueth not.</hi> He ſpeaks not of an Age, nor of years, nor of many dayes, but of a few days; mans days are ſhort in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſhorter in reſpect of the troubles that attends this preſent life.

                     <hi>Auſtin</hi> doubteth whether to call it a dying life, or a living death. Now theſe few days of mans life are upon the wing, haſtning and flying from us as the Eagle haſtneth to his prey; and therefore man had need ſet a greater price upon every moment and minute of time, then he does upon all the world, and accordingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If you conſider the life of man comparatively <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 'tis but ſhort, and that will appear briefly thus;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If you compare the life of man to what man might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> have reach't to, had, he continued in his primitive glory; had man ſtood faſt in innocency he had never known what death and miſery had mean't; death is a fall that came in by a fall; had man kept ſin out of the world, he had kept death out of the world; had man kept faſt his holineſs and purity, he had remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a piece of immortality to this day; death could never have carried man out of the world, had not man firſt let ſin into the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>ult.</hi>

                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, If you compare the life of man, to the long lives of the Patriarchs before the ſtood, then the life of man is but ſhort; threeſcore years and ten is mans age, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.10. And where one man lives to this age, how many thouſands die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come to it? But what is this age to the age that men lived to in former times? <hi>Enoch</hi> lived as many yeers as there be days in the year, and <hi>Adam</hi> lived nine hundred and thirty years, and <hi>Methuſelah</hi> lived nine hundred ſixty and nine years, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. Now what were <hi>Platoes</hi> eighty years, or <hi>Thomas Pars</hi> 160. years, or <hi>Johannes de Temporibus, John</hi> of the times, three hundred threeſcore and one years, to the long lives of the Patriarchs? and though in <hi>Davids</hi> time old age and ſeventy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſhook hands, yet 'tis otherwiſe in our times; for as mens wickedneſs do more and more increaſe, ſo their days do more and more decreaſe; the more wicked any generation is, the ſhorter liv'd, that generation ſhall be; God will quickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch them out of the world, who make quick diſpatches in ways of wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The life of man is but ſhort, if you compare it to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> what it ſhall be after the morning of the Reſurrection; O then mans day ſhall reach to eternity; eternity is that <hi>(unum perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum hodie)</hi> one perpetual day that ſhall never have end; when men after the reſurrection begin to live, they ſhall never dye after that day, every man ſhall live in everlaſting bliſs, or in everlaſting wo; when the laſt Trumpet has ſounded man ſhall live for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, The life of man is but ſhort, if you compare it with the days of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.5. Mine age is nothing before him, all time is nothing to eternity, mans life is but a minute, 'tis but a point of time to the days of eternity; what head, what heart can conceive or reckon up the duration of God, who ever was, who ſtill is, and who ever will be? every child, and every fool can tell you their age; but what man on earth, or what Angel in heaven can tell you the years of the Moſt High? ſurely none.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly and laſtly, the life of man is but ſhort, if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the lives of other creatures; ſome ſay that 'tis nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther age nor ſickneſs that killeth the Eagle; ſhe caſteth her

And ſome Elephants live three hundred years, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>Aelian, Solinus</hi> and <hi>Strabo,</hi> &amp;c. by all which you ſee the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of mans life; And why then ſhould man be ſo weak, ſo vain, as to put the day of his death ſo far from him? I have read of the Birds of <hi>Norway,</hi> that they flye faſter then the fowls of any other Country; they knowing by an inſtinct that God has put into them, that the days in that Climate are very ſhort (not above three hours long ſay ſome) do therefore make the more haſte to their neſts. And O! that all that hear me this day would learn by theſe birds of <hi>Norway,</hi> to make haſte to believe and to make haſte to repent and to make haſte to love God, and to make haſte to be holy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſeeing their day of life is ſo ſhort, and their night of death is poſting towards them.</p>
                  <p>And as the life of man is very ſhort, ſo 'tis very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that a very ſmall matter, a very little thing may quickly put an end to mans life. When the Emperor threatned the Philoſopher with death, he replyed,<note place="margin">Conrad. Veſ. perg. Nancler. &amp; Jo. Boel. in Adrian Paulus. Jovius, Elog. lib. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> what is that more then a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> flie may do? An ordinary flye flying caſually into the mouth of the proud Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> ſtifled him, that made the higheſt ſtate then in the Chriſtian world ſtoop, even to the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his ſtirrop. <hi>Tamberlain</hi> a <hi>Scythian</hi> Captain, the terror of his time, died with three fits of an Ague. <hi>Anacreon</hi> the Poet, was choaked with the kernel of a Grape. <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> was killed by the ſhell of a Tortoiſe, which fell from an Eagles Talons, who as ſome conceive took his bald head for a white rock. The Lord <hi>Mountaigne</hi> tells us of a Duke of <hi>Britany</hi> that was ſtifled to death in ſuch a throng of people, as is in ſome great congregations on the Lords day. An Emperor died by the ſcratch of a Comb; and one of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> died by the chock of an Hogg; and one that was brother to a great Lord, playing at Tennis, received a blow with a ball a little above the right ear, which ſtruck him into his grave. There is nothing ſo ſmall but may be a mans bane; The paring of a Toe, the cutting off a corn, the ſcratch of a nail, the prick
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:104351:159"/> of a pin, a fiſh-bone, a hair, a drop of water, a crum of bread, a bad air, or an evil ſmell may bring a man to his long home, yea a little ſmoak may ſoon ſtifle him, or his own ſpittle, let down unwarily may ſuddenly choak him.</p>
                  <p>And O! that all that I have ſpoken upon this account might be ſo bleſt, as to work you to take heed of putting the day of your death ſo far from you. The evil ſervant when he thought his Maſter was gone afar off,<note place="margin">Luke 12.45.</note> then he layes about him, diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers himſelf,<note place="margin">Prov. 7.19, 20.</note> and beats his fellow-ſervants. And ſo the leud woman in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> when the good man was gone a long journey, when he was far from home, then ſhe grew wanton, vain, and ſecure; ſo when men put afar off the day of their death, then they grow more looſe, prophane, and unholy; whereas a ſerious and frequent eying and minding of death, as at hand, as at a mans elbow, would alarm a man to break off his ſins by repentance, and to labor for holineſs, as a man would labor for life it ſelf. I have read of the women in the Iſle of <hi>Man,</hi> that the firſt Web they make is their winding ſheet, wherwith they uſually gird themſelves when they go abroad, to ſhew that they are ſtill mindful of their mortality. Ah friends, a conſtant minding of your mortality, would contribute very much towards the making of you holy: He that daily looks upon death, will be daily a looking after holineſs; the oftener any man looks into the grave, the oftener that man will be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to heaven, and a begging that God would make him holy even as he is holy.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly and laſtly, Take heed of ſettling your ſelves under a leud and ſcandalous Miniſtry, or of having any inwardneſs with ſuch whoſe lives give the lye to their Doctrine; an ill liv'd preacher is the greateſt deſtroyer of the ſouls of men; he that preacheth well, but lives ill, does what he can to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all his hearers at once; there is no greater bar to holineſs then Miniſters leudneſs; an unholy life marrs the ſoundeſt and the ſweeteſt Doctrine, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.16. The leaders of his people have cauſed them to ert. The ſins of Teachers are the teachers of ſins; as the corrupt gloſſes, ſo the leud practiſes of many Preachers, makes many to ſtumble at that word, and to ſhuff and chat, and conteſt, and kick againſt that word whereby they
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:104351:159"/> ſhould be made holy and happy for ever; a ſcandalous Miniſter is the greateſt Peſt, the worſe plague, and the ſoreſt miſchief that can be to a people, for his enormities, his wickedneſſes will have the ſtrongeſt influences upon the ſouls and lives of men to make them miſerable in both worlds; his falls will be the fall and ruine of many, for people are more prone to live by examples then by precepts, and to minde more what the Miniſter does then what he ſayes, and to eye more how he walks then how he talks. It was ſaid of One (long ſince) that was an excellent Preacher, but a very bad liver, that when he was in the Pulpit, it was pitty he ſhould ever come out of it, he preach't ſo well, and when he was out of it, it was pitty that ever he ſhould go into it he lived ſo ill. Certainly 'tis pitty that ever ſuch ſhould go into a Pulpit, who preach well but live ill, who have much of God in their mouths, and much of the devil in their lives, who have the earth as much at their fingers end, as they have heaven at their tongues end, who puts a loud lye upon the truth, and whoſe lives puts their words to a bluſh, who have much of heaven in their expreſſions, and nothing of heaven in their converſations, who have much holineſs in their books, but none in their boſoms, and much holineſs in their lips, but none in their lives; The leud lives of ſuch perſons cauſes people to ſlight and abhor the holy things of God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.17. yea their bad lives often raiſe doubts in their hearers hearts,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.22.

                     </note> whether thoſe things be true that they preach or no; hearers will be ready to object and ſay, if theſe things be true that the Miniſter ſays, why does he not practice what he preaches? why does he not do as well as ſay? and with what face or confidence can he appear againſt that in the Pulpit, which he countenanceth and patronizeth in his life; who will credit that mans Doctrine who has <hi>Jacobs</hi> voice but <hi>Eſaus</hi> hands, who is a Saint, yea an Angel in the Pulpit, but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched ſinner, yea an incarnate devil out of it?

Some (as they ſay of witches) cannot weep for ſin; but they that weep not for ſin here (where there are handerchiefs in the hands of Chriſt to wipe off their tears) ſhall weep out their eyes in hell hereafter; 'tis better to weep bitterly for thy ſins on earth, then to weep eternally for thy folly in hell.

'Tis an old obſervation, that the tears of repenting ſinners, are the wine of Angels. Certainly God himſelf can ſmile to ſee a ſinner grieve for his ſins, and to ſee him grieve that he can grieve no more,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.17.</note> for that he has ſinned againſt a God ſo great, ſo gracious, ſo bountiful, ſo merciful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though God be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with a ſinners ſins, yet he is very well pleaſed with a ſinners tears, and therefore as he has a bagg for the one, ſo he has a bottle for the other: It can't but be a pleaſure to God to ſee a ſinner drown his ſins in a deluge of penitential tears; though tears of indignation, as was <hi>Eſaus,</hi> and tears of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, as was <hi>Iſhmaels,</hi> and tears of deſperation, as was <hi>Judas's,</hi> be abominable to God, yet tears of godly compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and contrition, are acceptable and delightful unto God.

                  <p>Secondly, If ever thou wouldeſt be holy, thou muſt ſeek the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> holy Spirit; the ſpirit is the efficient cauſe of all that holineſs that is in the world. The Spirit of God is a Spirit of holineſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. he is frequently called the holy Spirit, <hi>Caſt me not away from thy preſence, and take not thy holy ſpirit from me,</hi> Pſal. 5.11. <hi>But they rebelled and vexed his holy ſpirit,</hi> Iſa. 63.10. <hi>And grieve not the holy ſpirit of God whereby ye are ſealed unto the day of redemption,</hi> Eph. 4.30. <hi>He therefore that deſpiſeth, deſpiſeth not man, but God, who hath alſo given unto us his holy Spirit,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.8. <hi>In whom alſo after that ye believed, ye were ſealed by the holy ſpirit of promiſe,</hi> Eph. 1.13. To make a man holy, is more then to create a world, 'tis a work too high and too hard for Angels or men, it becomes none, and it can be done by none but by the holy ſpirit; ſanctification is made the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:104351:162"/> ſpirits perſonal operation in that 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. and in that 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. 'Tis the great work of the ſpirit to ſhape, form, and faſhion the new creature holineſs in all the veſſels of glory. The ſpirit is the root of all holineſs, and therefore the ſeveral parts of holineſs are called the fruits of the ſpirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. 'Tis true, God purpoſes holineſs to his people, and Chriſt has purchaſed holineſs for his people, but 'tis onely the ſpirit that is the efficient cauſe or worker of holineſs in his people; though the Father, Son, and Spirit hath deſigned to re-imprint holineſs upon mans heart, yet the ſpirit has the greateſt hand in that work. When man was in his primitive glory, holineſs was his lovelineſs and his likeneſs to God, but being now faln, that image is ſo broken and mar'd, that no hand can repaire it or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it, but the hand of the ſpirit. The great principle of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which was in Chriſt (as to his humane nature) was the holy Spirit which he had above meaſure, for he was anointed with the Unction of the Spirit above his fellows. So that look which way you will, the Spirit ſtill appears to be the great principle of holineſs; holineſs is the very picture of God, and certainly no hand can carve that excellent picture but the ſpirit of God; Holineſs is the divine nature, and none can impart that to man but the Spirit. A man never comes to ſee his ſins, nor to be ſick of his ſins, nor to loath his ſins, nor to arraign his ſins, nor to condemn his ſins, nor to judge himſelf for his ſins (evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically) till he comes to be poſſeſt of the holy Spirit. A man never comes to ſpit out the ſweet morſels of ſin, he never come to make a ſacrifice of his onely <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and to cut his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate <hi>Agag</hi> in pieces, and to ſtrangle his <hi>Dalilah,</hi> and in good earneſt to ſet upon an utter exterpation of thoſe ſins that his conſtitution, inclination, cuſtome, calling, and intereſt does moſt incline him to, till a ſpirit of holineſs comes upon him; till this holy Spirit which is a ſpirit of judgement and burning, falls upon the hearts of ſinners, they will never be fired out of their pride, formality, carnality, ſenſuality and ſecurity; when this holy Spirit comes as a Spirit of Glory and Power to change thy heart, to deſtroy thy ſins, to reform thy ways, and to ſave thy ſoul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh then cry out, let him ſtill go on conquering and to conquer, till all his enemies ate made his footſtool. Oh

In that 5 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. there were certain times when the Angel came down and troubled the waters, and whoſoever did then ſtep in, was healed of whatſoever diſeaſe he had: So there are certain times and ſeaſons wherein the Spirit of holineſs ſtirs the heart and affections, and moves and breaths upon the ſoul; now if men were wiſe to obſerve theſe times and ſeaſons, they might be happy for ever; the time of the ſpirits moving is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable

                  <p>Thirdly, If ever you would be holy, then you muſt waite upon the word; the word of God faithfully preached, is the ordinary meanes by which holineſs is wrought in ſinners hearts; the word is that triumphant Chariot of the Spirit, wherein he rides conquering and to conquer the ſouls of men; the holy word is deſigned by God to beget holineſs in ſinners hearts, and to countenance, cheriſh, nouriſh, and ſtrengthen holineſs where it is begotten; <hi>John</hi> 17.17. <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth, thy word is truth.</hi> And for their ſakes, <hi>&amp;c.

So <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.3. <hi>Now ye are cleane through the word which I have ſpoken to you.</hi> The ordinary way of making uncleane ſouls cleane, unholy ſouls holy, is the Miniſtry of the word; <hi>Phil.</hi> 5.26. As there is a cleanſing vertue in the blood of Chriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. ſo there is a cleanſing vertue in the word of Chriſt; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.9. <hi>Wherewithall ſhall a young man cleanſe his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.</hi> Of all men, the young man is (uſually) moſt wild and wicked, moſt licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and rebellious, and yet the word of God is the power of God to his conviction and converſion, to his ſanctification and ſalvation; though the cleanſing of a young mans heart be one of the hardeſt works in the world, yet this may be done by the word: There are no luſts ſo ſtrong, but the word can caſt them downe, nor no ſtaines ſo deep, but the word can waſh them out. Three thouſand ſinners were made Saints by one Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. and five thouſand more were converted and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by another Sermon, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.4. Here were eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men cleanſed, ſanctified, and ſaved by two Sermons, and doubtleſs moſt of them were young. Oh Sirs, as ever you would have holy principles laid in your ſouls, and holy affections rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in your ſouls, and holy ends aimed at by your ſouls, heare the word in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, oh attend it, oh waite on it, 'twill be ſope to cleanſe you, and fire to purge you, and water to waſh you, and a winde to turne you from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.16,—24. The Goſpel preached hath been the power of God to the ſalvation of multitudes of ſouls, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. The word is that immortall ſeed, by which holineſs, which is not only a grace, but the conjunction of all graces, is formed in the ſoule, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. 'Tis the word that gives a ſpiritual Birth and Being to men, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. The word enlightens the eye, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.105. It ſoftens the heart, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.2.

Oh therefore heare it, and waite on it, and come to it, that you may be made holy by it; many come to heare the word to cenſure it, others to mock at it, others to inrich their

They came to catch, but were caught in that <hi>John</hi> 7.46. <hi>Auſtin</hi> coming to <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to have his ears tickled, had his heart touched and turned. <hi>Come,</hi> ſaith old Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Latimer</hi> (in a Sermon before King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixt) <hi>to the publick meeting,</hi>

                     <hi>though thou comeſt to ſleepe, it may be God may take thee napping.</hi> When thou comeſt, though it be but to taſte the Miniſters ſpirit, yet then God may take hold on thy ſpirit, and make it the day of his power upon thy ſoule; though thou comeſt with a heart full of prejudices againſt Chriſt, yet by the word thou mayeſt be brought to a love of Chriſt, to a liking of Chriſt, and to a choice of Chriſt, and to a bleſſed cloſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of thy ſelfe to Chriſt. They that came to ſurprize Chriſt, were ſo taken with Chriſt, that being filled with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration they could not but proclaime his divine Excellencies; <hi>Never man ſpake like this man.</hi> The word is the word of the Lord, let the hand be what it will that brings it. When gold is offered, men care not how noble or ignoble, how great or how baſe he is that offers it; ſo men ſhould not look ſo much at the hand that brings the word, as at the word it ſelfe; the word of the Lord was as much the word of the Lord, in the hand and mouth of <hi>Amos,</hi> who was raiſed a Prophet from amongſt the Heardſmen of <hi>Tekoa,</hi> as it was the word of the Lord in the hand and mouth of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who, as ſome think, was a Prophet of the blood-royall. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> obſerves of the Woman of <hi>Samaria, John</hi> 4.7. that ſhe came <hi>peccatrix</hi> to <hi>Jacobs</hi> Well, but ſhe went away <hi>praedicatrix,</hi> ſhe came a ſinner, but ſhe went away a Propheteſs. Oh Sirs, let nothing hinder you from coming to the word! oh come to the word; though you come ſinners, yet come, for though you doe come ſinners, yet you may goe away Saints; though the dew of heaven hath richly and ſweetly fallen
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:104351:164"/> upon your hearts, and yet, like <hi>Gideons</hi> ſleece, you are ſtill dry, yet come to the word ſtill, for who can tell but that by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next Sermon, God may make thy ſoule like a watered gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and like a ſpring of water, <hi>whoſe waters faile not,</hi> Iſa. 58.11.

In the time of the great Sweat in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes, as long as the heate of the plague laſted, O how did every one cry out, <hi>peccavi, peccavi, I have ſinned, I have ſinned, mercy Lord, O mercy, mercy good Lord.</hi> Then Lords and Ladies, and people of all ſorts, cryed out to the Miniſters, for the Lords ſake, Sirs, tell us what ſhall we doe to avoyd the wrath of the Lord? what ſhall we doe to be ſafe in this evill day? O take theſe bags and pay ſo much to ſuch a one whom I have deceived, and reſtore ſo much to ſuch a one whom I have in bargaining over-reached, O give ſo much to the poore, and ſo much to other pious uſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But after the ſickneſs was over, they <hi>returned with the dog to the vomit, and with the ſowe to the wallowing in the mire againe; and ſo their
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:104351:166"/> latter end was worſe then their former.</hi> There was a very great ſinner, who in the time of his ſickneſs was ſo ſorely terrified in his conſcience for his many hainous ſins, that he made the very bed to ſhake upon which he lay, and cryed out all night long, <hi>I am damn'd, I am damn'd, I am damn'd,</hi> &amp;c. and in this his ſickneſs he made many great proteſtations of amendment of life, if God would but be pleaſed to recover him, and prevent his going downe to the grave at this time; Well, in a ſhort time after, he did recover, and being recovered he was as baſe, wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and wicked, as ever he was before: This man with thoſe that were cited before him, were like that cunning Devill, of whom the Epigrammatiſt thus writeth; <q>

You count it a very ſhamefull thing to break promiſe or covenant with men, but is it not farre more ſhamefull to break with God? The <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (though Heathens) ſo hated perjury, that if any man did but ſwear by the life of the King, and did not performe his oath, that man was to dye, and no gold was to redeeme his life.<note place="margin">As <hi>Paulus Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> obſerves in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis,</hi> &amp;c.</note> When the <hi>Romans</hi> made Covenants, they took Stones in their hands and ſaid, <hi>If I make this Covenant ſeriouſly and faithfully, then let the great Jupiter bleſs me, if not, ſo let me be caſt away from the face of the gods as I caſt away this Stone.</hi> Covenant-breaking was a ſin greatly deteſted and abhorred among the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Heathens, and ſhall Chriſtians make nothing of breaking their vows, promiſes, and covenants with the great God.

The ſoul is the breath of God, the beauty of man, the wonder of Angells, and the envie of Devills, 'tis of an Angelical nature, 'tis a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſparke, a celeſtiall plant, and of a divine off-ſpring, 'tis a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſubſtance, capable of the knowledge of God, and of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, and of communion with God, and of an eternall fruition of God; there is nothing that can ſuit the ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low God, nor nothing that can ſatisfie the ſoule without God; the ſoule is ſo high and ſo noble a piece, that it ſcornes all the world in point of acceptation, juſtification, ſatisfaction, and ſalvation. What are all the riches of the Eaſt or Weſt <hi>Indies?</hi> what are rocks of Diamonds, or mountaines of gold, or the price of <hi>Cleopatra's</hi> draught, to the price that Chriſt laid downe for ſouls? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19.

In a word, the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall enemies which daily warre againſt the ſoule, the glorious Angels which hourely guard the ſoule, and the precious ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances which God hath appointed as meanes, both to convert and to feed the ſoul, doe all ſpeak out the preciouſneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the ſoule. There was once a great conteſt among ſome Nations about <hi>Homer</hi> (an excellent Poet) they ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

O Sirs, there is no wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome nor policy to that of ſecuring our precious ſouls, for they are Jewels of more worth then all the world; all the honours, riches, greatneſs, and glory of this world, are but chips and pibbles to theſe glorious pearles; therefore before all and above all other things, make ſure worke for your ſouls, if they are ſafe all is ſafe, but if they are loſt all is loſt: Other things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made ſure, riches cannot, for as they are lying, ſo they are flying vanities, they make themſelves wings, and they fly away; Honours cannot, <hi>Haman</hi> is feaſted with the King one day, and made a feaſt for Crowes the next; <hi>Herod</hi> is one houre cryed up for a God, and the next houre he is eaten of wormes; Princes Courts are very ſlippery, a man may quickly get a fall there, that may eaſily break both back and neck, as many in all ages have experienced; the applauſe and favour of creatures cannot, for many mens favours are got with an Apple, and loſt with a Nut;<note place="margin">Math. 27.4, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Judas</hi> his heart was hardly warm'd with the high Prieſts favour, before they ſhut their doores upon him, with a <hi>what is that to us? look thou to that;</hi> moſt mens favours are as light as a feather, and ſo tos't up and downe with every breath of windy vanity; the Moone do's not ſo often vary and change, as the reſpects of moſt men doe vary and change; how many men have had their names written in golden Characters one yeare, and in letters of blood the next? what is the favour of man, but a blaſt, a Sun-ſhine-houre, a puff of winde, a <hi>magnum nihil,</hi> a great nothing? and who then would ſpend an houres time to ſecure it? neare and deare relations cannot, for the delight of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> eyes is taken away with a ſtroake;<note place="margin">Ezek. 24.16.

But now holineſs may be made ſure, witneſs the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect in heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. and witneſs the many thouſands of Chriſtians this day in the world, who doe experience the principles of holineſs in their
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:104351:168"/> hearts, and who doe evidence the power of holineſs in their lives. O Sirs, if the ſerious conſideration of the preciouſneſs and worth of your ſouls, will not draw you out to ſtudy holineſs, to love holineſs, to prize holineſs, and to preſs after holineſs, what will? O Sirs, 'tis only holineſs that is the happineſs of the ſoul, the ſafety and ſecurity of the ſoul, the proſperity and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the ſoul, and the luſtre and glory of the ſoul; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why ſhould you not labour, as for life, after this ineſtimable Jewel holineſs? O let the remembrance of the preciouſneſs of your ſouls, be an effectuall means to draw you to heare that you may be holy, and to pray that you may be holy, and to reade that you may be holy, and to mourne that you may be holy, and to ſigh and groane after holineſs, as after that which is the ſouls only happineſs. O Sirs, there is nothing below heaven ſo precious and noble as your ſouls, and therefore doe not play the Courtier with your ſouls; now the Courtier do's all things late, he riſes late, and dines late, and ſups late, and repents late; O doe not poyſon your precious ſouls by groſs enormities, O doe not ſtarve your ſouls by the omiſſion of religious duties, O doe not murther and damne your ſouls, by turning your backs upon holy Ordinances. I have read of a Woman, who when her houſe was on fire, ſo minded the ſaving of her goods, that ſhe forgot her only childe, and left it burning in the fire; at laſt being minded of it, ſhe cryes out, <hi>Oh my childe, oh my poore childe, but all too late, all too late;</hi> ſo there are many men now ſo mad upon the world, and ſo bewitcht with the world, that they never mind, they never regard their poor ſouls, till they come to fall under everlaſting burnings, and then they cry out, O our ſouls, O our poor ſouls, O that we had been wiſe for our ſouls, O that we had got holineſs for our ſouls, O that we had made ſure worke for our ſouls, but all too late, all too late; the Lord make you wiſe to prevent ſoul-burnings at laſt. If he be rather a monſter then a man, that feaſts his ſlave, but ſtarves his wife, what ſhall we ſay of thoſe that pamper their bodies but ſtarve their ſouls, and that have thred-bare ſouls under ſilke and ſattin Cloaths, and that pleaſe themſelves with deformed ſouls under beautifull faces? ſurely it had been good for theſe that they had never been born. I have read of a <hi>Scythian</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:104351:168"/> who having for a draught of water yeelded up the City, cryed out, <hi>Quid perdidi? quid prodidi?</hi> What have I loſt? what have I betrayed? So all unholy perſons will at laſt cry out, we have betrayed our immortall ſouls, we have loſt a precious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we have loſt a deare Redeemer, we have loſt the company of glorious Angels, we have loſt the ſociety of the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, and we have loſt all the pleaſures and joyes and delights that be at the right hand of the moſt High; We have loſt theſe, we have loſt all theſe, and we have loſt them for ever and ever; ſurely there is no hell to this hell. For a cloſe of this direction, remember this, that as the ſoul is the life and excellency of the body, ſo holineſs is the life and excellency of the ſoul, and as the body without the ſoul is dead, ſo the ſoul without holineſs is dead; <hi>This my Son was dead, and is alive:</hi> if you get holineſs into your ſouls, your ſouls ſhall live for ever, but if you die without holineſs, your ſouls ſhall die for ever and ever. I have read, that there was a time when the <hi>Romans</hi> did weare Jewels on their ſhooes; oh that in theſe dayes moſt men did not doe worſe, oh that they did not trample under feete that matchleſs Jewel their preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſouls.

                  <p>Thirdly, For brevity; here you have much wrapt up in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> room he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fourthly, For perſpicuity; the foundations of Religion and happineſs are ſo plain and clear, that every one may run and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> read them. 'Twas a true ſaying of <hi>Auguſtin (Inclinavis Deus Scripturas, ad infantium &amp; lactentium capacitatem,)</hi> That God hath bowed down the Scriptures to the capacities even of Babes and Sucklings.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, For harmony; though there may ſeem to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> between Scripture and Scripture, yet there is a bleſſed harmony between all the parts of Scripture, the contrariety is ſeeming, not real; As when a man is drawing water out of a well with two veſſels of a different mettal, the water at the firſt ſeemeth to be of a different colour, but when he draweth up the veſſels nearer to him, the diverſity of colours vaniſh, and the water appeareth to be of one and the ſame colour, and when he taſteth them, they have one and the ſame reliſh: So though at firſt ſight there may ſeem to be ſome contradictions in the Scriptures, yet when we look more nearly and narrowly into them, and compare one place with another, we ſhall finde no contrariety, no repugnancy in them at all, but a perfect har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and a full and ſweet conſent and agreement between one place and another, between text and text, Scripture and Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, For verity; the Scriptures are moſt ſure and certain, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, before one jot or tittle of the Scripture ſhall paſs unfulfilled.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, For variety; there are no varieties to thoſe that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> are to be found in Scripture; as in <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark all ſorts of
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:104351:171"/> creatures were to be found, ſo in this heavenly Ark, the Scriptures, all varieties are to be found; here you may finde Phyſick for every diſeaſe, and Balm for every wound, and a plaiſter for every ſore; Here the Lamb may wade, and here the Elephant may ſwim; here is milk for Babes, and here is meat for ſtrong men; here is comfort for the afflicted, and ſuccour for the tempted, and ſupport for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, and eaſe for the wearied; here is a ſtaff to ſupport the feeble, and a ſword to defend the mighty. That which a Papiſt reports lyingly of their Sacraments, of the Maſs, <hi>viz.</hi> That there are as many miſteries in it, as there are drops in the ſea, duſt on the earth, Angels in heaven, Stars in the sky, Atoms in the Sun-beams, or ſands on the Sea ſhore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be truly aſſerted of the holy Scriptures; there are many thouſand thouſand varieties in this garden of Paradiſe, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eighthly, For fulneſs, the Scriptures are full of light, and full of life, and full of love; they are full of righteouſneſs, and full of holineſs, and full of all goodneſs. 'Twas a weighty ſaying of <hi>Tertullian, Adoro plenitudinem ſcripturarum,</hi> I adore the fulneſs of the Scripture. Many men talk much of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers Stone, that it turns Copper into Gold, and of <hi>Cornu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copia,</hi> that it had all things neceſſary for food in it, and of the Herb <hi>Panaces,</hi> that it was good for all diſeaſes, and of the Drugg <hi>Catholicon,</hi> that it is inſtead of all purges, and of <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> armor, that it was full proof againſt all thruſts and blows; but that which they vainly attribute to theſe things for bodily good, may ſafely and honorably be attributed to the bleſſed Scriptures in a ſpiritual manner; the Scriptures turns hearts of Copper into hearts of Gold; 'tis a Paradiſe that is full of the Trees of life,<note place="margin">Rev. 22.2.</note> and theſe trees of life are both for food &amp; Phyſick; here is all manner of fruit to feed you &amp; fill you, to delight you and ſatisfie you, and the very leaves of theſe Trees are ſingular medicines to heal you and cure you; the Scripture preſcribes the choiceſt druggs to purge you, <hi>viz.</hi> Repentance, and the blood of Chriſt; and 'tis the Scripture that furniſhes you with the beſt armor of proof againſt all principalities and powers, and againſt all ſpiritual wickedneſſes in high places.<note place="margin">Eph. 6.11.18.</note> Oh how

Ah friends, if you would but in good earneſt ſet upon reading of the holy Scriptures, you may finde in them ſo many happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes as cannot be numbred, and ſo great happineſſes as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meaſured, and ſo copious happineſſes as cannot be defin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſuch precious happineſſes as cannot be valued, and if all this wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>It's ſaid of <hi>Mary,</hi> that ſhe ſpent the third part of her time in reading of the word; and <hi>Caecilia</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Maiden of noble parentage, carried always about her the New Teſtament, and ſpent much time in reading it. <hi>Alfredus</hi> once King of <hi>England,</hi> compiled Pſalms and prayers into one book, and called it a <hi>Manuel,</hi> which he always carried about him, and ſpent much time in the peruſal of it. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>

Well if all this will not prevail with you to be much in reading of the Scriptures, conſider, that <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> an excellent King of <hi>Sparta</hi> would never go to bed, nor riſe up before he had looked into <hi>Homer,</hi> whom he called <hi>Amaſium ſuum,</hi> his ſweet heart; but what was <hi>Homers</hi> books to Gods Book, which is the book of books, as <hi>Charles</hi> the great did ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie when he crowned it with his own crown.

Oh ſirs, if <hi>Lipſius</hi> when he did but read <hi>Seneca,</hi>
                     <pb n="322" facs="tcp:104351:172"/> thought that he was even on the top of <hi>Olympus,</hi> above morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and humane things. And if <hi>Julius Scaliger</hi> thought twelve verſes in <hi>Lucan</hi> better then the German Empire; O then of what infinite worth and value is the bleſſed Scripture! ſhall Heathens take ſuch pleaſure in reading of the Works of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and ſhall not Chriſtians take as much pleaſure in reading of the holy Scriptures, wherein there is ſo much of the Spirit, hand, and heart of God? Shall they ſet ſo high a price upon the books of Heathens? and ſhall we ſo ſlight and undervalue the books of God, as not to thinke it worth a opening once a day; verily, I am afraid, I am afraid, that there are ſome among us, that hardly open their Bibles once a weeke, and others that hardly open their Bibles once a moneth, and not a few that hardly open their Bibles once a quarter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Certainly, as the ruſtineſs of ſome mens gold,<note place="margin">Jam. 5.1, 2, 3.</note> will be a witneſs againſt them in the great day of the Lord, ſo the muſtineſs of ſome mens Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles will be a witneſs againſt them in that great day.</p>

And whileſt <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerius</hi> read <hi>Luthers</hi> books with an intent to confute them, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was converted by them.

And venerable in all Ages and among all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, have been the books wherein the Laws either of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief or politie have been contained. As the <hi>Talmud</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Laws of the twelve Tables among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the <hi>Alcoran</hi> among the Turkes, yea all Pagans have highly valued the Laws of their Legiſlators, and ſhall not Chriſtians much more ſet an high eſteeme upon the holy Scriptures, which are the Map of Gods mercy and mans miſery, the touchſtone of truth, the ſhop of remedies againſt all maladies, the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of vices, and the treaſury of vertues, the diſplayer of all ſenſual and worldly vanities, the Ballance of equitie, and the moſt perfect Rule of all Juſtice and honeſty. What <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaid of old to his hearers, viz. <hi>Get you Bibles, for they are your ſouls Phyſick;</hi> that I ſay to you all, oh get you Bibles, for they are your ſouls Phyſick, your ſouls food, your ſouls happineſs. Ah friends, no book becomes your hands like the Bible; 'twas this book that made <hi>David wiſer then his Teachers;</hi> this is the book that makes the beſt preachers, and this is the book that is the beſt preacher; This book, this preacher will preach to you in your Shops, in your Chambers, in your Cloſets, yea in your own boſomes; This book will preach to you at home and abroad, 'twill preach to you in all companies, whether they are good or bad, and 'twill preach to you in all conditions, whether they are proſperous or afflictive; by this book you ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or by this book you ſhall be damned; by this book you muſt live, by this book you muſt die, and by this book you ſhall be judged in the great day, <hi>John</hi> 12.48.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eighthly, If ever you would be holy, then be much in prayer: Prayer is the moſt prevalent Orator at the throne of grace; many that have gon to that throne with tears in their eyes, have come away with praiſes in their hearts, and many that have gon to that throne with hearts full of ſin, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with hearts full of grace.<note place="margin">Hoſea 14.4.</note>

                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, The prayers of the wicked may be materially good, when they are not formally good, yea when they are Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logically evil, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.2. <hi>Amaziah</hi> did that which was perfect in the ſight of the Lord (as to the matter) but not with a perfect or ſincere heart; he failed not in the matter, but in the manner; he did not doe that good he did from principles of faith, love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor to a right end, divine glory; many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified perſons may have the gift of prayer, that have not the ſpirit of prayer,<note place="margin">Pſal. 78.36, 37.

Now certainly where God gives ſuch a gift, he requires the uſe of it; the gift of prayer is from the Spirit, as well as the grace of prayer; and who can tell but that upon the uſe of the gift of prayer, the Spirit may give the grace of prayer; however, 'tis dangerous to neglect a gift; the ſloathfull ſervant was not caſt into utter darkneſs for rioting out his Talent, but for not improving of his Talent. <hi>Math.</hi> 25.30. That the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of a wicked man are not formally good, muſt be granted, yea that they are abominable and ineffectual, cannot be denied; they are like the precious ſtone <hi>Diacletes,</hi> which though it hath many excellent Soveraignties in it, yet it looſeth them all if it be put in a dead mans mouth; ſo prayer though it hath many vertues and excellencies in it, yet it looſeth them all, when 'tis performed by a man that is ſpiritually dead, that is dead God-wards, and Chriſt-wards, and heaven-wards, and holineſs-wards; but if you conſider the matter of a wicked mans prayers, ſo they may be good, yea ſo good as that they may prevaile with a good God for much temporal good, as I ſhall ſhew you before I cloſe up all my anſwers to this objection.

As for a man wilfully and peremptorily to refuſe to heare the word, is a greater and a fouler fault, then to heare it with a forgetful or a diſobedient heart, there being more hope of the latter, then of the former; for ſome that have come to catch, have been caught by the word, <hi>John</hi> 7.46.

                  <p>Thirdly, If there were any ſtrength in this objection, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> would lye as ſtrong againſt a wicked man's civil actions, as it do's againſt his religious actions. <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.4. <hi>The plowings of the wicked is ſin;</hi> not only the prayers of the wicked, but alſo the plowings of the wicked are ſin, not only the ſpiritual but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the natural and civil actions of a wicked man are ſin; and therefore according to their arguing, a wicked man muſt not exerciſe himſelfe in his calling, in his plowing and ſowing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe that his civil actions are ſinfull as well as his religious, and 'tis as impoſſible for him to pleaſe God in the one, as 'tis to
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:104351:175"/> pleaſe him in the other; but ſurely all men that are in their wits, will either ſigh or laugh at ſuch kinde of reaſonings. But</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, This objection lyes as ſtrong againſt wicked mens natural actions, <hi>viz.</hi> their eating, drinking, and ſleeping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it do's againſt their praying;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.31.</note> when a wicked man eats, he is to eate to divine glory, and when he drinks, he is to drinke to divine glory, and when he recreates himſelfe, he is to recreate himſelfe to divine glory, and when he ſleeps, he is to ſleep to divine glory; in all theſe natural and common actions, he is to make the glory of God his ſupream ſcope. Now there is not a wicked man on earth, that do's or can eate o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to divine glory, he do's not nor cannot ſet up the glory of God as the chiefe and ultimate end of his natural and common acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now who but fooles in folio will reaſon thus, wicked men are to eate and drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to divine glory, but this they cannot doe, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.15. and therefore wicked men muſt neither eate nor drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, The force and ſpirit of this objection (if there were any in it) lyes as flat and full againſt all other religious duties, as it do's againſt prayer; it lyes as ſtrong againſt hearing, reading, and meditating on the word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it do's againſt prayer, and who but ſuch who are ſadly left of God, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully blinded by Satan, will be ſo wretched as to ſay, wicked men muſt neither heare the word, nor reade the word, nor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on the word, becauſe they cannot doe theſe actions in faith, <hi>and whatſoever is not of faith is ſin,</hi> Rom. 14. <hi>ult.</hi> But</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, There are thoſe that can ſay by experience, that the firſt ſpecial work of God that ever they perceived on their own hearts, was while they were pleading with God at the throne of grace; there are thoſe that have brought proud hearts to the throne of grace, but have returned with hearts humbled, and that have brought hard hearts, but have gon away with hearts graciouſly broken and melted, and that have brought carnal hearts, but returned with ſpiritual hearts, and that have brought worldly hearts, but returned with heavenly hearts. God ſometimes heares prayers for his own ſake, and for his Sons ſake, and for his glories ſake, and for his promiſe ſake, when he will not heare prayers for the ſinners ſake. But</p>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:104351:175"/>
                  <p>Seventhly, Sinfull omiſſions lead to ſinful commiſſions, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> yea ſometimes they lead to ruine; As you may ſee in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that fell from the higheſt heaven to the loweſt hell, and in <hi>Adam,</hi> who fell in paradiſe from the higheſt pinacle of glory, to the loweſt ſtep of ſin and miſery. Thoſe Reprobates in that 25 <hi>Math.</hi> did not rob the Saints, but only omitted the relieving of them, and this proved a damning to them: Rich <hi>Dives</hi> did not rob the poore, but his not relieving of them was his ruine, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> were baniſhed the Sanctuary to the tenth Generation for a meere omiſſion, becauſe they met not Gods <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs with bread and water, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.3, 4, 6. Look as the omiſſion of good dyet breeds natural diſeaſes in the body, ſo doth the omiſſion of good duties breed ſpiritual diſeaſes in the ſoul; all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>nful omiſſions make worke for hell, or for the Phyſitian of ſouls: Oh man thou doeſt not know what deadly ſin, what deadly temptation may follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a meere ſingle omiſſion. <hi>Origen</hi> going to comfort and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage a Martyr that was to ſuffer, was apprehended by the Officers, and conſtrained either to offer to the Idolls, or to have his body abuſed by a Blackamore that was ready preſt for that ſervice; being thus hard put to it, to ſave his life he bowed to the Idolls, but afterwards when he came to himſelfe, he ſadly bewailes his ſin, and confeſſeth that he went forth that morning without making his prayers unto God, which ſinful omiſſion God did ſo ſeverely puniſh, by leaving of him to fal into ſo great a ſin, which pierc'd his ſoul through with many ſorrows. I am apt to think that many a ſin, many a ſnare, and many a fall, might have been prevented, if ſuch and ſuch religious duties had not been omitted; ſinful omiſſions prepare the way to ſinful commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and both prepare the way to a fatal deſtruction. I believe many men had never been ſo abominable vicious, if they had not firſt caſt off religious duties; he that lives in the neglect of prayer, tempts more Devils then one to beſet his ſoule, yea to deſtroy his ſoule, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But,</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, and laſtly, there are ſeveral weighty arguments <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> that may be produced to prove, that 'tis the duty of wicked and unconverted men to performe religious duties, as to pray and ſeek the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Among the many that may be brought
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:104351:176"/> forth, I ſhall only give you theſe fix.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, This is evident from divine commands, as you may clearly ſee by comparing of theſe Scriptures together, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6, 7. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.21, 22, 23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.2. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Pray without ceaſing,</hi> is an indefinite injunction; and who art thou oh man, that dareſt to prohibite what God commands? are not his commands oblieging? and may not diſobedience to the leaſt of them, coſt thee thy life, thy ſoul, thy all? Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are neither to be ſlighted, cenſured, nor neglected; woe to him that looks upon great commands as little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and little commands as no commands, <hi>Math.</hi> 23. Oh Sirs, 'tis a very dangerous thing to act or run Counter-croſs to Gods expreſs command, it may coſt a man deare, as you may ſee in that ſad Story, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.24. The Heathens indeed would frequently run croſs to their gods commands, for when their gods commanded them to offer up a man, they would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up a Candle; and ſo <hi>Hercules</hi> when he was to offer up a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving man, he offered up a painted man: but do's it become Chriſtians to deale thus with the great God, with the living God, with the God of gods, as the Heathens did by their gods? ſurely no: Gods commands are not like unto the commands of the Heathens that might be contradicted and changed, but they are like to the commands of the <hi>Medes</hi> that cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed nor changed, they muſt be Evangelically obeyed, or you will be eternally deſtroyed.<note place="margin">Jer. 35.2, 5, 6, 7. Pſal. 103.20.</note> The <hi>Rechabites</hi> were very rigid obſervers of their fathers commands, and will you make ſlight of Gods commands? and <hi>the Angels that excell in ſtrength, doe his Commandements,</hi> and will you deſpiſe them? why ſhould the peaſant ſcorne that work, in which the Prince himſelf is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged? But,</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Prayer is a natural worſhip, and is incumbent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all men as they are created by God; prayer is a duty which the very Law of nature, as well as the Law of the word, lays up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men; And this you may ſee in thoſe Pagans, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>The Marriners cryed every man to his god.</hi> That there is a God, and that this God is to be called upon, are leſſons that are taught in natures Schoole; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.20. They pray to a god that cannot ſave; for any man to ſay, a wicked man ought not to
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:104351:176"/> pray, is to ſay a wicked man ought not to worſhip God, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be his maker; and who but ſuch who are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blinde or mad, dare ſpeak ſuch language? Certainly they that live in the neglect of prayer under the Goſpel, ſin againſt a double light, the light of nature, and the light of the Goſpel, and therefore they ſhall be double-damn'd; there is no hell to theſe mens hell, who ſin againſt a double light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The neglect of prayer is charged upon wicked <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> perſons as their ſin, as you may ſee by comparing of theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures together, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.2, 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.21. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 7.7. <hi>Zepha.</hi> 1.6. Now doubtleſs, if it were not a duty for unregenerate perſons to pray, it could never ſtand with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, juſtice, and righteouſneſs of God, to charge the omiſſion of prayer upon them as a ſin; but the omiſſion of prayer is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon them as a ſin, and therefore without all peradventure 'tis their duty to pray. But,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Wicked and unregenerate perſons are againe and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But,</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If abſolute promiſes or precious promiſes of ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> grace and mercy be made to ſinners as ſinners, then ſinners may in prayer plead out thoſe promiſes, and urge God upon making good his promiſes; but abſolute promiſes or promiſes of ſpecial grace and favour are made over to ſinners as ſinners, <hi>ergo,</hi> That ſuch promiſes are made over to poor ſinners as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is evident by comparing theſe Scriptures together, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.

Theſe words drop nothing but myrrhe and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; if <hi>Ennius</hi> could pick gold out of a dunghil, oh what gold, what comfort may be pick't out of theſe golden promiſes? In theſe words, let us conſider two things; Firſt, the precious promiſes that are here made; Secondly, the perſons to whom they are made. In the words you have four precious promiſes of ſpecial grace and favour, they are as ſo many ſtreames of grace flowing from the covenant of grace.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, You have here a promiſe of healing, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>I have ſeen his wayes, and will heale him,</hi> or as you may reade the words, though I have ſeen his wayes and courſes, and well obſerved how unworthily, how untowardly, and how obſtinately he has carried it, <hi>yet I will heale him, I will heale his backſliding nature;</hi> though his diſeaſe be dangerous, though it be very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, yet to an Almightie Phyſician, no diſeaſe is uncurable; I will heale his inſide by pardoning his ſin and purging his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,<note place="margin">Pſal. 103.3.

                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, In the words you have a promiſe of peace, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>I create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near,</hi> ſaith the Lord; the gemination of the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:104351:177"/> word <hi>(Shalom, Shalom) peace, peace,</hi> imports a large extent of peace, it notes true peace, firm peace, ſure peace, great peace, abundance of peace, yea conſtant &amp; laſting peace; under the name of peace in the Hebrew is denoted all manner of proſperity, and the Geminating of the word always notes a large meaſure of tranquility, plenty, proſperity, and felicity. Oh ſirs, peace with God, and peace with conſcience, and peace with the creatures, are all the products of Gods creating power and grace, 2 <hi>Eph.</hi> 16.17, 18. and ſo muſt be referred to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let us conſider the perſons to whom theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> promiſes are made; and here ſet us obſerve theſe three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Their ſin, and this you have in <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>For the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of his covetouſneſs I was wroth;</hi> The ſin that is charged upon him is a very great and grievous, 'tis a very vile and hainous ſin, 'tis called not onely covetouſneſs, but the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of his covetouſneſs, to ſhew the height and tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of this their wickedneſs, for covetouſneſs is a Mother-ſin,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 6.10.</note> 'tis a breeding ſin, 'tis a ſin that has all ſin in the womb of it, 'tis a ſin not onely againſt the light and law of grace, but alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the light and law of nature, for it makes the ſoul terrene which ſhould be celeſtial; and therefore the <hi>Perſians,</hi> though Heathens, have a law that no man ought to covet what belongs to any other man; And they have another Law, that they ought not to be worldly minded: No ſin lays men under greater woes: Wo to him that joyneth houſe to houſe; and wo to you Scribes, Phariſees and Hypocrites, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23: 'Tis an evil that ſubjects men to the baſeſt and vileſt evils, 'tis the root of all evil, it makes a man a fool, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.20. <hi>Thou fool, this night thy ſoul ſhall be taken from thee;</hi> It robes a man of all true peace, comfort, content, and quiet; it brings men into ſnares which drowns their ſouls in perdition; It renders men unſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under all their outward enjoyments; though a covetous wretch may have enough to ſink him, yet he can never have enough to ſatisfie him; firſt he wiſhes for a bagg full, and then a cheſt full, and then a chamber full, and then a Church full, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The plague of unſatisfiedneſs is none of the leaſt of
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:104351:178"/> plagues that covetous men are under. Certainly you ſhall as ſoon fill a triangle with a circle, and a cheſt with grace, and the body with aire, as you ſhall be able to fill and ſatisfie a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous mind with money: In a word, covetouſneſs is a ſin that renders a man unſerviceable in his generation; a covetous man is like a Swine, that is good for nothing whilſt he lives; the Horſe is good to bare and carry, the Ox is good to draw, the Sheep is good for cloth, the Cow is good to give milk, and the Dogg is good to keep the houſe, but the Hogg is good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whilſt he lives; ſo a covetous man is neither good for Church nor State, he is no wayes ſerviceable in his generation, onely when he is dead; that Scripture often proves true, <hi>viz. That the riches of a ſinner are laid up for the juſt,</hi> Job 27. By all which you may ſee the greatneſs of this ſin of covetouſneſs that is ſo cloſely charged upon them. But,</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, He grew worſe under the afflicting hand of God, <hi>I was wroth, and ſmote him, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart;</hi> They were like peviſh, froward, ſtubborn chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that grow more croſs, crooked, and perverſe under all the chaſtenings of their Father; and this was no ſmall aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſin,<note place="margin">Lib. de ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitione.</note> that they grew worſe under the Rod. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> writes, that 'tis the quality of Tygres, that if the Drums or Tabou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, He perſever'd and went on againſt all gain-ſayings; <hi>I have ſeen his ways,</hi> that is, I have ſeen his obſtinacy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigibility in ſin: Ah poor creature (ſays God) he ſees not his preſent miſery and ſlavery, he takes no notice of his own folly and vanity, of his own frowardneſs and peviſhneſs, he ſcorns to bend or bow under my mighty hand, he is reſolved to ſtand it out to the death, he will perſiſt on in his own wayes, though he eternally periſhes; though hell ſtands at the end of his ways, yet on he will: Well what is the iſſue of all this? God ſaith, <hi>I have ſeen his ways, and will heal him;</hi> 'tis not I have ſeen his ways, and will curſe him, no, but <hi>I have ſeen his ways, and will heal him;</hi> 'tis not I have ſeen his ways, and will never have any
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:104351:178"/> more to do with him, no, but <hi>I have ſeen his ways, and will heal him;</hi> 'tis not I have ſeen his ways, and will damn him, no, but <hi>I have ſeen his ways, and will heal him.</hi> Oh the freeneſs, Oh the unſearchableneſs, Oh the riches of Gods grace! And thus you ſee that the precious promiſes laſt cited, are promiſes that are made over to ſinners as ſinners; And this is further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in that <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.22, 23, 24, 25. For ſins of omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſins of commiſſion, what can be more charged upon a ſinful people, then here is charged upon them? they were not onely negligent of his worſhip and ſervice, but they were alſo weary of his worſhip and ſervice, and counted it rather a burden then a benefit, a toyl then a pleaſure; in all their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obſervances they did but court the Lord, they did but complement with God, for whilſt they were in his ſervice, their hearts were ſecretly weary of his ſervice; and by their ſinful commiſſions, Oh how did they grieve, vex, oppreſs, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the Holy one of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> and yet in <hi>verſ.</hi> 25. God does paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately and emphatically proclaim their free pardon, <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins.</hi> The Metaphor is taken from mens blotting out of debts out of their debt-book; now when a debt is blotted out of the debt-book, 'tis never charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the debtor more, 'tis never regarded nor remembered more; ſo when God proclaimes the ſinners pardon, when he forgives him his tranſgreſſions, he blots, he raſes, he croſſes his books, and cancels all bonds, ſo as that he will never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject his ſins againſt him, and never charge his ſins upon him, but being once forgiven, they ſhall be for ever forgotten, they ſhall never come into his remembrance more: And all this he will do for his name ſake, and for the praiſe and glory of his own Free-grace.

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:104351:183"/> Chriſt bid the Palſie man <hi>riſe and walk, take up thy bed, and go unto thine houſe;</hi> the Palſie man might have objected, Alas, I am carried by four, I am not able to ſtir a limb, muchleſs to riſe, but leaſt of all to take up my bed and walk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh but he puts forth himſelf as well as he could, and a power went forth with the command, that enabled him to do what was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.

There was a poor man that had a withered hand, &amp; Chriſt commands him to ſtretch forth his hand; he might have objected, my hand is withered, and if I might have a thouſand worlds to ſtretch it forth, I could not ſtretch it forth, yea, if my life, if my ſalvation did lye upon ſtretching forth my withered arm, I could not ſtretch it forth; Oh but he throws by all objections, and complies as well as he could, and a power went forth and healed his hand. God commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to go and deliver his people out of <hi>Egypt; Moſes</hi> might have objected his old age, the power of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and his want of an Army to force their way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he turns his back upon theſe objections, and addreſſes himſelf to the work, and ſuch a mighty power went along with him as did effect it;<note place="margin">Joſh. 6.</note> he commanded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to take Rams horns, and with them to go and blow down the walls of <hi>Jericho;</hi> they might have ſaid, Lord theſe are weak and contemptible means, yea Lord, if we may ſpeak after the manner of men, they are ſuch ridiculous means as will expoſe us to ſcorn and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but they paſs over theſe things, and apply themſelves to thoſe weak and deſpicable means that God had appointed, and ſuch a divine and glorious power went along with the means as made the walls of <hi>Jericho,</hi> not onely to tremble, but to tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble down before them.

'Tis a dangerous thing to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the doing of that which thou canſt doe, becauſe that thou canſt not doe every thing that thou ſhouldeſt doe.

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, I anſwer, that 'tis thy wiſdom and thy work to ſet one may be againſt another;<note place="margin">Eccl. 7.14.</note> thou ſay'ſt now, that hereafter may be time enough to look after holineſs.

                        <p>Fourthly, I anſwer, that the brevity, ſhortneſs, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of time,<note place="margin">Sumptus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiociſſimus tempus. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtus.</hi>

But,</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, I anſwer, that 'tis the greateſt folly and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> madneſs in the world for thee to put off the great God and the great concernments of thy ſoule, ſo, as thou dareſt not put off thy Superiors: Where is the ſubject that dares put off a lawfull duty urg'd upon him by his Prince with a may-be, or with an hereafter it may-be I will doe it, or hereafter I will doe it? or where is that ſervant that dares put off his Lords preſent commands with a may-be, or with an hereafter it may-be I will doe it, or hereafter I will doe it? or where is the ingenious child that dares put off a preſent duty preſt upon him by his parents with a may-be, or with an hereafter it may-be I will doe it, or hereafter I will doe it? or where is the affectionate wife, that dares put off the juſt deſires and requeſts of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band with a may-be, or with an hereafter it may-be I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer your deſires, or hereafter I will anſwer your requeſts? O Sirs, you dare not put off your Superiors with may-bees, or with hereafters, and how then doe you dare to put off the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, with may-bees and with here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>afters? it may-be I will look after holineſs, it may-be I will ſtudy holineſs, it may-be I will prize holineſs, or hereafter I will preſs after holineſs, I will purſue after holineſs, hereafter I will follow hard after holineſs.

Now what a mercy muſt it be to

And therefore, doubtleſs, God can't doe the ſoul a greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, then to take it off from ſuch vaniſhing pleaſures; all ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual pleaſures defile the ſoul, they debaſe the ſoul, yea they debauch the ſoul, they take off the heart from God, and they deaden the heart towards God. <hi>The widow whilſt ſhe lived in pleaſure is reckoned dead,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.6. She is dead God-wards, and dead Chriſt-wards, and dead Duty-wards, &amp; dead Heaven-wards, and dead Holineſs-wards, <hi>&amp;c. Ariſtotle</hi> writes of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of ground in <hi>Sicily,</hi> that ſends forth ſuch a ſtrong, ſuch a ſweet ſmell of fragrant flowers, that no Hounds can hunt there; ſo the carnal pleaſures of this world doe ſend forth ſo ſtrong a ſcent, that unſanctified perſons cannot hunt after God, nor Chriſt, nor holineſs, nor the great concernments of another world, and therefore 'tis rather mans felicity then his miſery to be taken off from ſuch vaine pleaſures: ſenſual pleaſures and delights cannot ſatisfie the ſoul of man, they are but frothy and flaſhy, they only wet the mouth, they never warme the heart; a man may ſooner break his neck, then ſatisfie his heart with ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual pleaſures; they are <hi>Juno's</hi> in the purſuit, and but clouds in the enjoyment. <hi>Xerxes</hi> being weary of his ſenſual pleaſures, promiſed great rewards to them that ſhould invent new plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and when they had invented new pleaſures and delights,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:104351:191"/> yet then he could not be ſatisfied nor contented, he would fain have had one pleaſure to have taken off the wearineſs of another, but it could not be; there is nothing in carnal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights but imagination and expectation, for they can neither fill the heart nor ſatisfie the heart.</p>
                        <p>O ſirs, there is no real pleaſure in ſin, all the pleaſures of ſin are counterfeit pleaſures, they are but the ſhapes and ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of pleaſure, they are the ſeeds of future grief, they are but an earneſt laid down for ſorrow or ruine. It is obſerved by the Mythologiſts, that pleaſure went on occaſion to Bathe her ſelf, and having ſtript off her cloaths by the water ſide, ſorrow having hid her ſelf at hand, ſteals the cloaths away, puts them on, and ſo departs: So that carnal pleaſures are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſorrow in pleaſures cloaths. Certainly if there were the leſt real delight in ſin, hell could never be hell, yea then it would follow that hell ſhould be the greateſt place of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for doubtleſs hell is the greateſt place of ſin. O don't deceive your own ſouls, there can be no real joy in ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. What real delight or pleaſure can there be in Tipling and Fudling in an Ale-houſe or Tavern, in ſwaggering and ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in Dicing and Carding, in Dancing, Masking and Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in ſlighting of Sabbaths, in ſcoffing at Saints, in deſpiſing of Ordinances, and in purſuing after lying vanities? ſurely none. And as for thoſe ſeeming pleaſures that attend the ways of ſin; Ah how ſoon do they vaniſh and leave a ſting behind them. Now all the pleaſures that holineſs deprives you of, are only ſuch that you may better ten thouſand times want, then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. Look as all the pleaſures that manhood takes a man off from, are Babiſh and toyiſh pleaſures; as from delighting in a Rattle, a Pipe, a Feather, a Hobby-horſe, a wooden Sword, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So all the pleaſures and delights that holineſs takes a man off from, they are babiſh and fooliſh, yea they are baſe, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and deviliſh; and therefore it muſt needs be rather a high felicity, then a miſery, for God to take thee off from ſuch ſinful pleaſures and delights, by laying principles of holineſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy heart. O! remember that holineſs will be no loſs unto thee; it will be onely an exchange of ſinful delights, for thoſe that are holy, and of carnal for thoſe that are ſpiritual, and of

                        <p>There was not one of thoſe perſecuting Emperours that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on the Ten bloody perſecutions againſt the Saints, but came to miſerable ends; yea Hiſtories tell us of three and forty perſecuting Emperours, who fell under the revenging hand of God, and came to untimely ends. Among the many thouſand thouſands of inſtances that might be given of the Judgements of God that have fallen upon the perſecutors of the people of God in theſe latter dayes, I ſhall only give you a few. <hi>Faelix</hi> Earle of <hi>Wartenburge</hi> was a great perſecutor of the Saints, and ſwore <hi>that ere he dyed he would ride up to the ſpurs in the blood of the Lutherans;</hi> but the very ſame night wherein he had thus ſworne and vowed, he was choaked with his own blood: nothing would ſerve him but the blood of Gods people, and God makes him drunk with his own blood. Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> once Lord Chancelour of <hi>England,</hi> was a ſworn enemy to the Goſpel, and perſecuted the Saints with fire and faggot; and amongſt all his praiſes, he reckons this the chiefeſt, <hi>that he had been a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Lutherans,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Saints;</hi> but what became of him? he was firſt accuſed of Treaſon, and then condemned, and at laſt beheaded. Judge <hi>Morgan</hi> was a great perſecutor of the people of God; but ſhortly after he had paſſed the ſentence
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:104351:203"/> of condemnation upon that vertuous Lady, the Lady <hi>Jane Grey,</hi> he fell mad, and in his mad raving fits he would continually cry out, <hi>Take away the Lady Jane, take away the Lady Jane from me;</hi> and in that horror he ended his wretched life. <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homira,</hi> after the death of her husband, uſurped the Government of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and was a cruell perſecutor of the people of God; but by a righteous hand of God it ſo fell out, that on that very place where the Miniſters bones lay unburied, the earth opened of it ſelf, and ſwallowed her up alive, with her Chariot and thoſe that were in it, which place is now to be ſeen before the Caſtle of <hi>Prague.</hi>

                           </note> The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Toures</hi> was an earneſt Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor for the erection of a Court called <hi>Chamber Ardent,</hi> for the condemning of the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants to the fire, but before he dyed he had fire enough, for he was ſtricken with a diſeaſe called, <hi>The Fire of God,</hi> which began at his feete, and ſo aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upward, which occaſioned one member to be cut off after another, and ſo he ended his miſerable dayes. <hi>Thomas Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was a grievous perſecutor of the people of God, and a great ſuſpender and ſilencer of good Miniſters; he made uſe of his tongue, braines, and power to ſtop the mouthes, and tye up the tongues of Gods faithfull Miniſters; but God in his righteous Judgement ſo ſtruck him in his tongue, that it ſwel'd ſo big, that he could neither ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low nor ſpeak for ſome dayes before his death, and ſo he was ſtarved, choked, and killed by this ſtrange tumour of his tongue.<note place="margin">Mr. Groves <hi>Gleanings. p.</hi> 155, 156.</note> I have read of one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>W.</hi> who was very buſie in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting an Indictment againſt his Miniſter at a Quarter Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for omitting the Croſs in Baptiſme; and being a man in high favour with the Juſtices, he made no queſtion of prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; at night (according to his uſual manner) he falls to drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till he was ſo extream drunk that he was faine to be carried home; in the morning his wife began mildly to blame him for his acting againſt the Miniſter the day before, at which he with fearefull oathes ſwore, <hi>that he would ſoon rid the Towne of that Puritan;</hi> but behold the hand of God, for as this wretched man was about to riſe, and having put one arme in his Dublet (even as the oathes were uttering) he was taken ſpeechleſs, yea and ſenſleſs, and ſo dyed. To conclude, the Judgements of God
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:104351:204"/> upon the perſecutors of the Saints in <hi>Bohemia</hi> was ſuch, that it was uſed as a Proverb among the adverſaries themſelves, <hi>that if any man were weary of his life, let him but attempt againſt the</hi> Piccardines (for ſo they called the Saints) <hi>and he ſhould not live a yeare to an end.</hi> And thus you ſee by theſe inſtances, that moſt ſevere Judgements have ſtill followed the perſecutors of the people of God: Let me cloſe up this argument thus; look as in Princes Courts they are judg'd but ſilly ſhallow, brain'd men, that profeſs open and mortall hatred to the greateſt favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of the King, becauſe in ſo doing they take the right and ready way to ruine themſelves and families; ſo they are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the moſt ſilly ſhallow-brain'd men in the world (how wiſe ſoever they may be in their own eyes, or in others eyes who are like unto themſelves) who perſecute the favourites of the King of Kings, that being the ready way to their owne ruine and deſtruction.

Perſecuted Saints are like Cammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile which grows and ſpreads by being trod upon; the more perſecutors tread upon the people of God, the more they will ſpread and grow. <hi>Auſtin</hi> has long ſince obſerved, that though there were many thouſand Chriſtians put to death for profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Chriſt, yet they were never the fewer for being ſlain. <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate deviſed all manner of torments to terrifie the people of God, and to ſuppreſs them, and yet they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and multiplyed ſo faſt, that at laſt he thought it his beſt courſe to give over perſecuting of them, and this he did not out of love to them, but becauſe the more they were perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the more they increaſed.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Diocleſians</hi> time under whom the laſt and worſt of the ten perſecutions fell, for then Chriſtian Religion was more deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately oppoſed and perſecuted then ever, and yet then Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion proſpered and prevailed more then ever;<note place="margin">Ruffinus.</note> ſo that <hi>Diocleſian</hi> himſelf obſerving that the more he ſought to blot out the name of Chriſt, the more legible it was, and the more he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored to block up the way of Chriſt, the more paſſible it was, and that whatever of Chriſt he though to root out, it rooted the deeper, and roſe the higher, thereupon he reſolved to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage no further, but retired to a private life.</p>
                        <p>And it is very obſervable, that the reformation in <hi>Germany,</hi> was much furthered by the very oppoſition that the Papiſts made againſt it; yea, and 'tis not to be forgotten, that when two Kings wrote againſt <hi>Luther, viz. Henry</hi> the eighth of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ludovicus</hi> of <hi>Hungary,</hi> this Kingly Title being
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:104351:211"/> entred into the controverſie, made men more diligently and curiouſly to examine the matter, by which means there was ſtir'd up in men a general inclination to <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion.</p>
                        <p>I have read of one who obſerving the Chriſtian Religion to be ſo furiouſly perſecuted by bloody <hi>Nero,</hi> concluded that ſurely that muſt needs be good, yea very good which was ſo cruelly perſecuted by <hi>Nero</hi> who was ſo bad, ſo very bad: if men would ſit down and ſtudy which way to make moſt proſelytes to ſuch and ſuch opinions and practices that are different from their own, certainly they cannot pitch upon a better way then to perſecute thoſe that differ from them; 'tis the ſword of the Spirit, and not the ſword of perſecution that will reduce the erroneous; when the diſeaſe lies in the head, the remedy muſt be anſwerable to the diſeaſe: certainly a man ſhall as ſoon conquer a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle by Spiritual arguments, as he ſhall conquer a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by club-law; when our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſent forth his Diſciples to make a conqueſt upon an ignorant, erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, and deluded world, he did not ſend them forth with ſwords, piſtols, or any ſuch military weapons; O no, but he ſent them forth under the choice anointings of his Spirit, and with his everlaſting Goſpel, and by theſe means he turned the world upſide down; theſe were the means by which he turned ſinners from darkneſs to light,<note place="margin">Acts 26.18.</note> and from the power of Satan to Jeſus Chriſt. The weapons that the Apoſtles uſed were not carnal, but Spiritual. 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10.4, 5. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but Spiritual,<note place="margin">Vide Calvin, Beza, <hi>and</hi> Eſtius.</note> and mighty through God to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, caſting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt.

<pb n="402" facs="tcp:104351:212"/> before the Spirit and the word of the Lord in the mouths of his faithful Miniſters; by theſe Spiritual weapons Satan was diſarmed, and rebellious tranſgreſſors were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, captivated, and ſubdued to the obedience of the Lord Jeſus. But,</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The troubles, afflictions, and perſecutions that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall you in the purſuit after holineſs, may iſſue in the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſalvation of others, as is evident in <hi>Acts</hi> 8. which Chapter I recommend to your moſt ſerious peruſal. So in that 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9, 10. <hi>Wherein I ſuffer trouble as an evil doer, even unto bonds, but the Word of God is not bound,</hi> (though <hi>Paul</hi> was fettered,<note place="margin">

                              </gap>, For this cauſe.</note> yet the word was free) <hi>Therefore I endure all things for the Elects ſakes, that they may alſo obtain the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is in Chriſt Jeſus, with eternal glory. Paul</hi> for preaching of the Goſpel clearly and faithfully was impriſoned at <hi>Rome,</hi> and handled as if he had been a malefactor, all which he was contented to ſuffer upon theſe very grounds, that the Elect might be called, converted, ſaved and glorified. 'Tis very obſervable, that though <hi>Paul</hi> was a priſoner, yet he preacht; though he was in bonds,<note place="margin">Several of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles were written when he was in bonds.</note> yet he preacht; and though he was accounted as an evil doer, yet he preacht, that the Elect might be ſanctified and ſaved; Though his perſecutors did lay Irons upon his legs, yet they did not lay a law of ſilence upon his lips; and though they ſhut him up from going to others, yet they did not ſhut out others from coming to hear him; for even in bonds he exerciſed his miniſterial office: As cruel as his perſecutors were, they would not ſhut the priſon doors upon them that waited on his Miniſtry. So <hi>Philemon</hi> was converted by <hi>Paul</hi> when he was in bonds, <hi>Phil. v.</hi> 10. <hi>I beſeech thee for my ſon Oneſimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds. Paul</hi> had a bleſſing going along with his Miniſtry, when he was in bonds as well as when he was at liberty. <hi>Oneſimus</hi> was converted when <hi>Paul</hi> was a priſoner; God made <hi>Pauls</hi> priſon to be a Paradiſe to <hi>Oneſimus; Paul</hi> by his preaching, patience, and chearfulneſs in ſuffering, converts <hi>Oneſimus</hi> to the faith: priſons in theſe times were turn'd into Churches; And ſo they were in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Act.</hi> and <hi>Mon.</hi> fol. 1457.</note> for as bloody as her Raign was, moſt of the priſons in <hi>England</hi> were turn'd into Chriſtian
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:104351:212"/> Schools and Churches (ſaith Mr. <hi>Fox</hi>) ſo that there was no greater comfort then for Chriſtians to reſort to priſons, and to hear the Martyrs to pray and preach, and to behold their holy, humble, heavenly, gratious converſation.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ibid.</hi> 1381.</note> So the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and perſecutions of the Saints in the primitive times iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the converſion and ſalvation of many ſouls. We read that <hi>Cicilia</hi> a poort Virgin by her gracious behaviour in her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, was the means of converting 400. to Chriſt. <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> by ſeeing the Martyrs ſuffer ſo patiently and chearfully, was converted to the faith, and afterwards ſealed to the truth with his blood. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> was alſo converted in the ſame way. In the third perſecution, <hi>Fauſtus</hi> and <hi>Jobita,</hi> Citizens of <hi>Brixia,</hi> ſuffered Martyrdom with ſuch invincible patience, courage, and chearfulneſs, that <hi>Caeloccrius</hi> cryed out <hi>(Vere magnus Deus Chriſtianorum)</hi> Verily great is the God of the Chriſtians; Upon which words he was preſently apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo ſuffered martyrdom with them. And that was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ſaying of <hi>Luther (Eccleſia totum mundum convert it ſanguine &amp; oratione)</hi> the Church converteth the whole world by blood and prayer. Now if by your troubles, afflictions, and perſecutions, and the exerciſe of grace under them, you ſhall be inſtrumental to convert and ſave a ſoul or ſouls from wrath to come, it will turn wonderfully to your advantage, and you ſhall <hi>ſhine as the ſtars for ever and ever,</hi> Dan. 12.3. That ſame power, preſence, wiſdom, and grace, that convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed others by the ſufferings of former Saints, is able to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the ſame glorious effects by the ſufferings of the Saints of this Generation; and therefore beare up bravely, and neither fear nor faint under your preſent ſufferings. But,</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, The troubles, afflictions, and perſecutions that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Chriſtians meet with in their purſuit after holineſs, will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the increaſe and growth of their grace; grace never riſes to ſo great a height as it do's in times of perſecution; ſuffering times are a Chriſtians Harveſt times.<note place="margin">Pſal. 69.7, 8, 9, 12.</note> Let me inſtance in that grace of zeal: I remember <hi>Moulin</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants, ſaith, <hi>When Papiſts hurt us for reading the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, we burn with zeal to be reading of them; but now perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution is over, our Bibles are like old Almanacks,</hi> &amp;c. All the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:104351:213"/> reproaches, frowns, threatnings, oppoſitions, and perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that a Chriſtian meets with in a way of holineſs, doth but raiſe his zeal and courage to a greater height. <hi>Micha's</hi> ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing at <hi>David</hi> did but inflame and raiſe his zeal:<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6.20.21, 22.</note> 
                           <hi>If this be to be vile, I will be more vile.</hi> Look as fire in the winter burns the hotter (by an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi>) becauſe of the coldneſs of the air; ſo in the winter of affliction and perſecution, that divine fire, the zeal of a Chriſtian, burns ſo much the hotter, and flames forth ſo much the more vehemently and ſtrongly. In times of greateſt affliction and perſecution for holineſs ſake, a Chriſtian hath, firſt, a good Captain to lead and encourage him; Secondly, a righteous cauſe to prompt and embolden him; Thirdly, a gracious God to relieve and ſuccour him; Fourthly, a glorious heaven to receive and reward him; and certainly theſe things cannot but mightily raiſe him and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame him, under the greateſt oppoſition and perſecution; Theſe things will keep him from fearing, fawning, fainting, ſinking, or flying in a ſtormy day; yea theſe things will make his face like the face of an Adamant, as God promiſed to make <hi>Ezekiels:</hi>

                           </note> Now an Adamant is the hardeſt of ſtones, 'tis harder then a flint, yea 'tis harder then the nether-milſtone. The Naturaliſts obſerve, that the hardneſs of this ſtone is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable; the fire cannot burn it (nor ſo much as heat it tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row) nor the hammer cannot break it, nor the water cannot diſſolve it, and therefore the Greeks call it an Adamant from its untameableneſs; and in all ſtorms the Adamant ſhrinks not, it fears not, it changeth not its hue; let the times be what they will, the Adamant is ſtill the ſame; in times of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a good cauſe, a good God, and a good conſcience will make a Chriſtian like an Adamant, 'twill make him invincible, and unchangeabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Look as Well-water is warmeſt in the winter time, ſo real Chriſtians are warmeſt for God, his glory, truth, and ways, in the winter of affliction and perſecution: true grace riſes by oppoſition &amp;

                           <note place="margin">Rev. 14, 1.—6.</note> All the afflictions and perſecutions that befall the people of God, do but add to their ſpiritual life, light, and luſtre. As Stars ſhine brighteſt in the darkeſt nights, and as Spices ſmell ſweeteſt when pounded, and as Vines are the better for bleeding, and Gold the brighter for ſcowring, and Palm-trees the better for preſſing; ſo the graces of the Saints ſhine brighteſt, and ſmell ſweeteſt, and riſe higheſt in times of affliction and perſecution. The Naturaliſts have long ſince obſerved, that though the South wind be more pleaſant, yet the North wind is more healthfull; for the South wind with his warmth raiſeth vapours, which breed putrefaction, and cauſe diſeaſes; but the North wind with his cold drieth up thoſe vapours, purging the blood, and quickning the ſpirits: ſo the North wind of affliction and perſecution, contributes moſt to the drying up of ſinful vapours, and to the quickning up of a Chriſtians Graces. Though the wind may blow, and the rain in ſtormy weather may beat upon a painted Poſt or Sign, whoſe colour is laid in oyle, yet the wind and rain is ſo far from blowing or waſhing off the colour or beauty that is upon the Poſt or Sign, that it rather adds to their beauty, and makes them ſhine more beautifull then before; ſo the rain of affliction and the wind of perſecution, do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther add to the beauty and luſtre of a Chriſtians graces, then any way cloud them, or take off the ſpiritual beauty and glory of them.

                        <p>Fifthly, Perſecuting times are uniting times; oh the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the diviſion, the wrangling, biting &amp; quarrelling that is to be found among profeſſors in times of peace &amp; proſperity! but when affliction and perſecution comes upon them, this
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:104351:214"/> unites them together.<note place="margin">In perſecuting times the Saints have been but as one man; which made their very perſecutors to ſay <hi>(Ecce ut invicem ſe diligunt!)</hi> ſee how theſe Chriſtians love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſee how they knit and cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! <hi>Euſebius in Hiſt.</hi> Pſalm 83.3. to verſe 9. 2 Chron. 20.1, 4, 12.</note> Though the ſheep in Sun-ſhine dayes feed at a diſtance, and wander one from another; yet when a ſtorm comes, or the Wolf comes, then they run all together; and ſo it's with Chriſtians: Some Religious Biſhops that could by no means agree when they had their freedom and liberty, yet could well enough agree when they were in priſon together. Though children in a Family may fall out among themſelves, yet they quickly unite when a common enemy aſſaults them. Perſecuting times unite Chriſtians cloſer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their affections, reſolutions and prayers: they who formerly could hardly be brought to eat together, or trade together, or live together, or walk together, in perſecuting times will be brought to hear together, and pray together, and faſt together, and communicate experiences together, and ſtand together, and fall together, and riſe together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When <hi>Gebal</hi> &amp; <hi>Ammon</hi> and <hi>Amaleck</hi> did combine, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God kept cloſe together: for they very well knew that broken forces were ſoon diſſipated.

As all the ſtones that came about <hi>Stephens</hi> ears, did but knock him cloſer to Chriſt the corner ſtone: ſo all the ſtones that come about the Saints ears, will but knock them the nearer to Chriſt, and the cloſer one to another. But,</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, As perſecuting times are uniting times, ſo perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting times are truth-advancing times: truth thrives moſt when it is moſt oppoſed and peſecuted, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.12, 13, 14. <hi>But I would ye ſhould underſtand, Brethren, that the things which hapned unto me, have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the Gospel; So that my Bonds in Chriſt are manifeſted in all the palace,</hi>

                           </note> if <hi>Paul</hi> a priſoner holds up and holds on in preaching the word, though he be in bonds &amp; chains; ah how much more ought we who are at liberty to hold up &amp; hold on in preaching the truth, and advancing the truth, &amp; in ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the truth! There were many that took an occaſion from <hi>Pauls</hi> impriſonment, bonds, and ſufferings, to diſgrace his Apoſtleſhip; the Apoſtle meets with theſe, and tells them, that though they deſigned and intended the diſgrace and hinderance of the Goſpel by his impriſonment and bonds; yet God had by his wonderfull providence and goodneſs ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the matter, that his bonds and impriſonment turned to his great honor and fame, and an occaſion of further ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and advancing the Goſpel. Though Satan and his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may diſturb the truth, yet they cannot ſuppreſs it; for <hi>(magna eſt veritas &amp; praevalebit)</hi> great is truth, &amp; ſhall prevail. So upon the perſecution of <hi>Stephen</hi> many of the Brethren preached the word far and near, and the hand of the Lord was with them to the converſion of many, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.19.—25. Now they which were ſcattered abroad upon the perſecution that aroſe about <hi>Stephen,</hi> travelled as far as <hi>Phenice,</hi> &amp; <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> preaching the word to none but the <hi>Jews</hi> only; and ſome of them were men of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Cyrene,</hi> which when they were come to <hi>Antioch,</hi> ſpake unto the <hi>Grecians,</hi> preaching the Lord Jeſus; and the hand of the Lord was with them; and a great number believed, &amp; turned unto the Lord. Then tidings of theſe things came unto the ears of the Church which was in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and they ſent forth <hi>Barnabas,</hi> that he ſhould go as far as <hi>Antioch:</hi> who when he came, and had
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:104351:215"/> ſeen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpoſe of heart they would cleave unto the Lord. For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghoſt, and of faith; and much people were added unto the Lord. The Brethren that were diſperſed and ſcattered by reaſon of perſecution, fall upon preaching of the Lord Jeſus; and though they were Lay-men, yet the hand of the Lord was mightily with them, ſo that a great number believed and turned to the Lord. God is a free agent, and can work the hearts of men over to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by what hand he pleaſes, and many times he doth the greateſt works by the moſt deſpiſed hands,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.21, 25, 27.</note> as it is evident in this inſtance. The Apoſtles did not fret, and fume, and ſtorm, and take on, becauſe theſe Brethren preacht the Lord Jeſus without ordination to the work of the Miniſtry. O no; but they were glad and rejoyced in their bringing in of ſouls to Chriſt, and they made it their work to exhort, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and build up thoſe that were brought in; neither did they prohibit theſe Brethren from preaching, becauſe they had not Apoſtolical hands laid on them. By theſe Lay-mens preaching, Chriſt is revealed, and multitudes are converted, and truth is advanced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Apoſtles are gladded. Now by what hath been ſaid, it is moſt evident that perſecuting times are truth-advancing times. But,</p>

Will you be ſo favourable to your ſelves as to compare your ſufferings with the ſufferings of former Saints, and that you may, let me give you a little Breviate of their ſufferings of whom the world was not worthy.

In <hi>Syria,</hi> a company of Chriſtian virgins were ſtript ſtark-naked to be ſcorned by the multitude, then ſhaved, then covered with ſwill and draffe, and then torne in pieces and devoured by ſwine. 30.

                        <p>Secondly, God does this ſometimes by ſetting perſecutors <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> one againſt another. When the <hi>Moabites</hi> were confederated with the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Mount-Seir</hi> againſt <hi>Judah,</hi>

When the Emperor of <hi>Germany</hi> threatned utter ruine to all the Proteſtants within his Empire, God let looſe the Turk to fall with great fury upon his Empire, and by that means diverted the Emperors rage, and preſerved his poor people, which were as ſheep appointed to the ſlaughter. Ah <hi>England,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:104351:220"/> England,</hi> if God had not ſet thine enemies together by the ears, year after year, how had they combined and conſpired together to have ſwallowed thee up long before this day. But,</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, God does ſometimes ſave his people from perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, by paſſing a ſentence of death upon their perſecutors: And thus by his ſudden and fearful judgement upon <hi>Herod,</hi> he gave reſt, liberty and quiet to his people, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.23, 24. And ſo by his vengeance on perſecuting Emperors, he gave reſt to his people. When <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate had vowed to to make an oblation of all the lives of the ſurviving Chriſtians (as <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> reports) God ſtruck him with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from heaven,<note place="margin">Orat. <hi>4.</hi> in Iul.</note> ſo that he died reviling of Chriſt, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his blood to heaven, as if he would have caſt it into the very face of Chriſt. And when <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Tyrant endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to deſtroy the Armies of the Chriſtians, under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> God gave the very winds a command to wreſt the weapons out of their enemies hands, and ſo preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his people. And in 88. how did God make the very winds to fight for his people, and ſo ſaved them from that bloody invaſion, by cauſing his winds to blow, and their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to ſink as Lead in the mighty waters. And by giving <hi>Achitophel</hi> Rope enough, he preſerved <hi>David</hi> from periſhing. But,</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, God does this ſometimes by altering and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very hearts and natures of their perſecutors. And thus by changing <hi>Pauls</hi> nature,<note place="margin">Acts 9.31.</note> by turning that Wolf into a Lamb, that devil into a Saint, he gave the Churches reſt throughout all <hi>Judea, Galilee</hi> and <hi>Samaria;</hi> and this is one of the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable things in the world, that God would ſave his people from outward ruine, by ruining their perſecutors ſins, and by changing their hearts and ſaving their ſouls. This way God has taken, and this way God may take (being a free Agent to work, when and where, and how, and on whom he pleaſes) but I can't turn to a promiſe, wherein he has engaged himſelf to make converts of perſecutors; his common way of dealing with ſuch, is to give them up to blindneſs of mind, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, and ſearedneſs of conſcience, and perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:104351:220"/> of ſpirit, that ſo their hell may be the hotter at laſt. But,</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, God does this ſometimes, by taking perſecutors feet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> in the ſame ſnares that they have laid for others; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.16.<note place="margin">Pſal. 57.6.</note>

As every

God many times delights to confute the devils Proverb, <hi>viz.</hi> That plain dealing is a Jewel, but he that uſeth it, ſhall die a Beggar. Now God by heaping up riches and honor, and greatneſs upon the righteous, gives the devil the lye, and lets the world ſee that holineſs many times is the ready way to worldly greatneſs.</p>
                        <p>'Tis obſervable, that when all the ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> returned with corn and money in their ſacks from <hi>Egypt,</hi>

As there was none ſo holy as Chriſt, ſo there was none ſo poor as Chriſt; Chriſt lived poor and died poor, for as he was born in another mans houſe, ſo he was buried in another mans Tombe. <hi>Auſtine</hi> has long ſince obſerved, that when Chriſt died, he made no Will, he had no crown lands,<note place="margin">If there were any happineſs in riches, the Gods would not want them, ſaid <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca.</hi>
                           </note> all he had was a coat, and that the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers parted amongſt them; had there been any true happineſs or bleſſedneſs in Gold and Silver, gay clothes, ſtately Manſions, brave attendants, or in well furniſhed Tables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt who was (and ſtill is) the Lord of all, would certainly have been ſo favorable to himſelf, and ſo kind to his diſciples, as not to have deprived himſelf or his Family of that happineſs and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which they might have enjoyed, by enjoying the brave things of this world; but he very well knew that true happineſs and bleſſedneſs was too great and too glorious a thing to be found in any ſuch worldly enjoyments, and upon that foot was willing to be without them himſelf; &amp; in his wiſe providence he ſo ordered the affairs of his own houſe, that thoſe whom he loved beſt ſhould have leaſt of thoſe things wherein there was no true happineſs. <hi>Lazarus</hi> was very poor, but very holy; he was houſeleſs, but not Lordleſs; his body was clothed with raggs, but his ſoul was adorned with grace; he had no bread to eat, and yet he had bread to eat that the world knew not of; whilſt he lived, the Doggs (being more kinde then their Maſter) lick't his ſores, but when he died, the Angels carried him into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom. In all Ages this has been an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced truth, that moſt men are beſt in at low condition. Pope <hi>Martin</hi> reports of himſelf, that whilſt he was a Monke, and lived in the Cloyſter, he had ſome evidences for heaven, but when he was a Cardinal, then he began to fear and doubt
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:104351:226"/> whether ever he ſhould go to heaven; but afterwards when he came to be Pope, he utterly deſpaired of ever going thither. Ah how holy, how humble, how heavenly, how gracious, how ſerious, how zealous, how prudent, how vigilent, and how diligent have many men been in theſe late years, whilſt their condition was low, and poor, and mean in the world? but when under various changes they changed their Braſs into Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, their Copper into Gold, their Cottages into Palaces, their Shops into Lordſhips, and their Shipskins into Scarlet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ah how proud, how ſtately, how earthly, how carnal, how careleſs, how cold, how formal, how lukewarm, how indifferent, how light, how ſlight, how vain, how looſe did they generally grow. I think ſince Chriſt was on earth, there has not been a more evident proof of mens being beſt when their condition was loweſt, then what has been given within theſe late years. <hi>Mandrobulus</hi> in <hi>Lucian</hi> offered to his god the firſt year Gold, the ſecond year Silver, and the third year nothing at all; ſo many in our times, who were forward in the days of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and adverſity to offer Gold and Silver (I mean prayers and praiſes) to God, yet in the days of their proſperity and worldly glory, they offered either nothing to God, or elſe that which was next to nothing. I have read of the Pine-tree, that if you pull off the Barke it will laſt a long time, but if the Barke continue on, it will rot the Tree.

And, O that now their barke is taken off, they may with the Pine-tree grow better and better; O that now they may grow more holy then ever, and more humble then ever, and more heavenly then ever, and more ſpiritual then ever, and more watchful then ever, and more faithful then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and more friendly then ever, and more united then ever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now if moſt men are beſt in a low condition, then there is no reaſon why any man ſhould turn his back upon holineſs becauſe of poverty, that often treads upon holineſs heels. The Cypreſs-Tree is high, but barren, and the Olive-Tree is low, but fruitful. Ah Chriſtians 'tis infinitely better to be an Olive-Tree,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:104351:227"/> low and fruitful, to be low in the world, and full of the fruits of righteouſneſs and holineſs, then to be a Cypreſs-Tree, high in honors, riches, and worldly greatneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to be barren of all grace and goodneſs. But,</p>

Ah, what will not a ſoul blinded by ſin ſay and doe, when the work of holineſs is not formed in him? Sin has certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt that ſinner into a wofull Lethargy, who is the father of this objection; now 'tis obſerved of thoſe that are fallen into a Lethargy, that their bodies are ſubject to a continuall drowſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and their memories are ſo weak that they cannot remember any thing that they ſpeak or do, nay it do's ſo far debaſe them, that they forget the very neceſſary actions of life; and juſt ſo has ſin dealt with theſe Objectors ſouls, it has caſt them under ſuch a ſpirituall drowſineſs, yea it has caſt them into ſuch a deadly and fearfull ſleep, that it makes them forget the <hi>unum neceſſarium,</hi> the one thing neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> holineſs. Souls under a ſpirituall Lethargy, forget their loſt and lamentable condition, they forget how far off they are from God, Chriſt, heaven, and ſalvation, and they forget how neare they are to hell, to ruine, to everlaſting burnings, and to utter perdition and deſtruction. It is obſervable of the Smiths dogge, that neither the noyſe of hammers by him, nor the ſparks of fire flying about him, nor thoſe that light upon him, doe any whit awaken him, but he

When a man is in a deep Lethargy, if you pinch him with pincers, or prick him with needles, he feels it not, if you ſcourge him he cryes not, if you threaten him he feares not, or if you ſpeak him faire he regards it not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now this is the condition of ſuch that are in a ſpirituall Lethargy, let the Judgements of God be denounced, and let the terrours of the Law be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched they tremble not, let the flames of hell-fire flaſh upon their ſouls they regard it not, for they are Sermon-proof, and Judgement-proof, and hell-proof. Now this is thy very caſe O ſinner, who cryeſt out that the purſuit of holineſs will turne to thy diſgrace and diſcredit in the world; for were thy eyes but open to ſee the neceſſity, beauty, &amp; excellency of holineſs, O then thou wouldſt call for holineſs, and cry for holineſs, and ſearch for holineſs, &amp; preſs for holineſs, as that which is the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ornament, &amp; the only honor and glory of the Creature.

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, and laſtly, I anſwer, That there are no perſons under heaven that ſtand ſo much obliged to look after holineſs, and to preſs with all their might to obtaine holineſs, as the rich, the great, the mighty, and the honorable of the earth; For, firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> why has God made them greater then others, but that they ſhould labour to be better then others? they are therefore higher then others, that they may be holier then others; the greatneſs of their outward glory, calls aloud upon them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in ſanctity; and woe to them that are reſolv'd to be worſe then others, becauſe God has done more for them then he has <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> for others. Secondly, They of all men have more time, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and advantages to heare much that they be holy, and to reade much that they may be holy, and to pray much that they may be holy, and to confer much with all ſorts and ranks of men, that they may be holy; and therefore it concerns them above all other men in the world to be holy: Other men have neither the time, nor the advantages to gaine holineſs as theſe men have: The poor people in <hi>Sweden</hi> ſay, that 'tis only for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Gentlemen to keep the Sabbath. But, Thirdly, Their examples are moſt powerfull and prevalent with the people, either for much good,<note place="margin">Pro. 29.12.</note> or for much evill. If the mountains overflow with waters, the vallies are the better; and if the head be full of ill humors, the whole body fares the worſe. The Actions of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers are moſt commonly rules for the peoples actions, and their examples paſſeth as currant as their Coine:<note place="margin">Eſth. 1.10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>Vide.</hi> Its no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in King <hi>Alphonſus</hi> ſayings, that a great man cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a ſmall ſin.</note> If their examples are evill, there are none ſo dangerous as theirs. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat,</hi> is never mentioned in the Scripture, nor never read of in the <hi>Chronicles</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but he draws a Tayle after him, like a blazing Star, <hi>who made Iſrael to ſin.</hi> A ſick head diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordereth all the other parts, and a dark eye benights the whole body. The evill examples of great men, corrupts the Aire round about. The common people are like tempered wax, eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving impreſſions from the Seals of great mens vices. If a Peaſant meet with Luxury in a ſcarlet Robe, he dares be ſuch, having ſo faire a cloake for it. If the vulgar people meet with
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:104351:231"/> drunkenneſs under a black Caſſock, they dare be ſuch; they make no bones on't to ſin by preſcription, and to damn themſelves with Authority. <hi>Auſtin</hi> brings in ſome excuſing their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances with the ſinfull cuſtomes of thoſe times in drinking healths, thus, Great perſonages urged it, and it was at the Kings Banquet, where they judged of Loyalty by Luxury, and put us upon this election, drink or die; they thought it a ſufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe to plead the examples of great men.</p>
                        <p>And if their examples are vertuous, there are none ſo win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and drawing as theirs.<note place="margin">

As the biggeſt Stars in the Firmament are alwayes the brighteſt, and gives the greateſt luſtre to thoſe of a leſſer mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude; ſo thoſe that in reſpect both of Greatneſs and grace, are as ſo many ſhining Stars, they give the greateſt light and luſtre to others by their ſhining converſations. O! what a world of good will the gracious example of a good Prince provoke unto. 'Twas the ſaying of <hi>Trajanus</hi> a Spaniard, <hi>Qualis Rex, Talis Grex,</hi> Subjects prove good by a good Kings example. Stories tells us of ſome that could not ſleep when they thought of the Trophies of other Worthies that went before them; the gracious examples of great men are very awakening, quickning, and provoking to that which is good; as is moſt evident in all thoſe Kingdomes, Countries, Cities and villages, where ſuch men live. And therefore great men are the more obliged to be good men, and honorable men to be holy men. But,</p>

Look as the leaſt joy in heaven infinitely ſurpaſſeth the greateſt comforts on earth, ſo the leaſt torments in hell, doe infinitely exceed the greateſt that can be deviſed here on earth: for a cloſe remember this, as there are degrees of glory in heaven, ſo there are degrees of torment in hell; and as thoſe that are moſt eminent in grace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,<note place="margin">Math. 10.15.

                        <p>But I ſhall ſay no more to this objection, becauſe I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken very largly to this objection in my former books. If you deſire further ſatisfaction to this objection, turn to that Treatiſe called <hi>Apples of Gold,</hi> &amp;c. and from Page 311. to Page 327. you will finde ſeven more diſtinct anſwers to it. And ſee alſo my <hi>Mute Chriſtian under the ſmarting Rod,</hi> and from Page 304. to Page 326. you will finde eight anſwers more to this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I confeſs ſeveral other objections might be made againſt your purſuing after holineſs, but becauſe I have ſpoken to them at large in my former writings; therefore I ſhall not trouble you with them here; and therefore let thus much ſuffice for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to thoſe objections that uſually men make when they are preſt home to follow after holineſs.</p>

And here let me exhort ſuch.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, To expreſs, declare, evidence, and hold forth both the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> reality and power of holineſs; and that,</p>

The Babylonians beholding the enormities of the Jews, cryed out, Theſe are the people of the Lord, theſe are come out of the Lords land. <hi>Davids</hi> one act of folly with <hi>Bathſheba</hi> made the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme.

A Chriſtian can't after his converſion fall into a ſcandalous ſin, but 'twill be objected againſt him by every one, to the defacing and darkning of all his ſpiritual glory. When <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> was cured (and as ſome think converted) by the Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> he offers gold and rich garments,<note place="margin">2 Kings 5.1, One flaw in a Dyamond takes away the luſtre and the price of it; and if we fall but once into a puddle, it will defile us, and make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one point at us.</note> but he bows in the houſe of <hi>Rimmon;</hi> he ſeems to be very devoute and religious, but he bows in the houſe of <hi>Rimmon;</hi> he promiſes to offer to none but the Lord, but yet he bows in the houſe of <hi>Rimmon;</hi> this <hi>Rimmon</hi> like the flye in the Alabaſter box, ſpoyl'd all his beſt intentions, and higheſt reſolutions; and thus one ſcandalous vice diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth all the Noble vertues that be in a Chriſtian. O ſuch a man is a very holy man, but; and ſuch a one is a very gracious experienced Diſciple, but; and ſuch a one is a very wiſe and underſtanding man, but; and ſuch a one is a very active ſtirring Saint, but, &amp;c. and this <hi>but</hi> marrs all. If there be but one crack in the honey-glaſs, there the waſpe will be buzing; and if there be but one ſcandalous ſin that a Chriſtian falls into in all his life, how will the wicked be ſtill a buzing of that about, both in City and Country? O ſirs, there are no ſins that opens ſo many mouthes, and that ſads ſo many hearts, and that ſwells
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:104351:239"/> ſo many eyes, and that endangers ſo many ſouls, as ſcandalous ſins doe; and therefore above all keeping keep off from them.

O how ſower would all thy mercies taſt? and how pale and wan would all thy mercies look, were it not for holineſs? 'Tis the want of holineſs that makes all a mans mercies look as ill-favoured as <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> leane kine,<note place="margin">Gen. 41.2, 3, 4.</note> and 'tis the fruition of holineſs that makes all a mans mercies look as well-favour'd as <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> fat-kine; 'tis holineſs that both puts a colour upon all our mercies, and that gives a taſt and a relliſh to them: All our mercies without holineſs, will be but as the waters of <hi>Marah,</hi>

O Sirs, will you lament ſuch as are fallen from riches to poverty, from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor into diſgrace, and from the higheſt pitch of proſperity to the loweſt ſtep of beggary and miſery; and will you not lament ſuch who are fallen from the higheſt round to the loweſt round in <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder? O Sirs, will you mourne over a decayed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate? will you weep over decayed friends? and will you ſigh and ſob over a decayed body? and will you not much more lament and mourne over decayed ſouls, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Ah how many have loſt that love,<note place="margin">Rev. 2.4, 5.</note> that life, that heat, that zeale, that readineſs, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, and that reſoluteneſs that once they had for God and godlineſs.

Now what ſpeaks all theſe ſad complaints, but either a total want of holineſs, or elſe a very great decay of holineſs: And if you look among all other rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as husbands and wives, parents and children, Magiſtrates and people, Miniſters and Chriſtians; oh what ſad diviſions, what fiery contentions, and what feareful Jars are there to be found? oh what ſlightings, what revilings, what under-valuings, what heart-riſings, what heart-ſwellings, and what heart-burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are to be found amongſt them? and what doe all theſe things declare, but that the Glory of God is departed from <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and that holineſs is fallen to a very low ebbe? ah friends, were there but more holineſs among you, there would be more union among you, and more love among you, and more ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and tenderneſs among you, and more forbearance and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience among you; Oh then you would never be ſnarling one at another, nor biting one of another, nor plotting one againſt another, nor devouring one of another any more. Again, if you look among men, whoſe parts are great, whoſe gifts are high, whoſe profeſſion is glorious, and whoſe expreſſions and notions are very ſeraphical, ah what a little holineſs will you finde? O Sirs, ſhall the men of this world vex and fret, ſhall they weep and waile, and ſhall their lamentation and mourning be like that of <hi>Hadadrimmon</hi> in the valley of <hi>Megiddo,</hi>

The Eagle is the King of Birds,<note place="margin">Ariſtotle l. <hi>9.</hi> de Hiſtoria A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimalium, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Fourthly, You Have but a little holineſs, witneſs your eaſie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> your ready, and your frequent fallings before temptations and motions to ſin. O! ſirs, when the temptation does but touch and take, when you are no ſooner tempted but you are conquered, no ſooner aſſaulted but you are vanquiſhed, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly holineſs is at a very low-ebb in your ſouls. That Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (without all peradventure) is very weak, that is taken at the firſt aſſault, and that ſhip is but meanly man'd that is carried at firſt boarding, and that ſouldier is but ſlightly arm'd that is run through at the firſt thruſt; and ſo that Chriſtian has but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſpiritual ſtrength in him who is worſted and vanquiſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt appearance of a temptation. When mens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings are eaſily corrupted with error, or their judgements with levity, or their wills with frowardneſs, or their affections with diſorderedneſs, or their conſciences with unrighteouſneſs, 'tis a very great argument that there is but little holineſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. O! ſirs, men eminent in holineſs, in their ordinary courſe have been always eminent in the reſiſting and withſtanding of temptations, as is evident in <hi>Joſeph, Job, Daniel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 39. Job 1.3. and 6. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Daniel.</hi>

<pb n="474" facs="tcp:104351:248"/> 
                        <hi>Beza</hi> was tempted in the like caſe, he anſwered, whatſoever I was, I am now in Chriſt a new creature, and that is it which troubles thee Satan; I might have continued in my ſins long enough ere thou wouldſt have vexed at it, but now I ſee thou doſt envy me the grace of my Saviour. And when <hi>Auguſtin</hi> was ſadly reviled by the Donatiſts for the wickedneſs of his youth, he anſwered, The more deſperate my diſeaſe was, ſo much the more I admire the Phiſitian. Thus men eminently holy have ſtood their ground in the face of all temptations and motions to ſin; but alas, in theſe times how eaſily, how readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and how frequently do multitudes fall before every temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation?<note place="margin">Joſh. 7.21.</note> As ſoon as <hi>Acan</hi> had but caſt his eye upon the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh garment and ſhekels of Silver, and wedge of Gold, his fingers itch't to be handling of them; ſo many in theſe days, as ſoon as they do but ſee the way to honor or preferment, or a great place, or a high office, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O how do their fingers itch, how do their ſouls long after theſe things? and though they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor and ſmell never ſo ſtrong of <hi>Babylon</hi> or of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet have them they muſt; ſuch perſons may do well to remember, that <hi>Acans</hi> Babyloniſh garment was but a ſhrow'd to ſhrow'd him, and his golden wedge was but a wedge to cleave him, and his ſhekels of ſilver were but ſhekels to hold him the faſter, both under the wrath of God and man. Such as can turn with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry winde, and cloſe with every worſhip, and bow to every Idol that man ſets up, have either no holineſs, or elſe but very little holineſs in their hearts; ſuch as eaſily and readily fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore temptations from within or without, have never it attain'd to any great meaſures of holineſs.

So many in theſe days, who though they carry it fair, and make a goodly ſhew, yet they riot out all that ſpiritual ſap and life that is in them into the mear leaves and bloſſoms of an empty profeſſion. Ah how are many of our hearts like to the Iſle of <hi>Pathmos,</hi> which is ſo barren that nothing that is good will grow on't, all the good things that grow there is from the earth that is brought from other places. Look as a company of Ants are very buſie about a Mole-hill running to and fro, and wearying themſelves in their ſeveral movings and turnings this way and that, and yet never grow great, for after all their motions and ſtiring, they are ſtill the ſame as to the ſlender proportion of their bodies; ſo, many Chriſtians in theſe days run to and fro, they run from one duty to another, and from one ordinance to another, and from one opinion to another, and from one principle to another, and from one Miniſter to another, and from one Church to another, and from one way to another, and from one notion to another; and yet they make little progreſs in holineſs,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.18. 2 Tim. 3.6, 7.</note> they grow but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in the love, the life, the likeneſs, and the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; they are like thoſe ſilly women that <hi>Timothy</hi> ſpeaks of, who were ever learning, and yet never able to come to the knowledge of the truth; and they are like <hi>Nazianzens</hi> country of <hi>Ozizala,</hi> which abounded, with gay flowers, but was barren of corn; ſo theſe abound in gay notions, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing parts, but are barren of grace and holineſs. <hi>Seneca</hi> hath long ſince obſerved, that as the Philoſophers in his time grew more and more learned, ſo they grew leſs and leſs moral; and is there any thing more evident in theſe days then this, <hi>viz.</hi> that as men grow more and more in empty airy notions, and in a pompous Religion and profeſſion, ſo they grow leſs and leſs zealous and religious. The reaſon (ſay ſome) why Chriſt cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Fig-tree, though the time of bearing fruit was not come, was becauſe it made a glorious ſhew with leaves, and promiſed much, but brought forth nothing.

O Sirs, there

They ſhall ſtill bring forth fruit in old age, they ſhall be fat and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing.</hi> The promiſe of flouriſhing is three times repeated in theſe three verſes, they ſhall flouriſh, they ſhall flouriſh, they ſhall flouriſh, to note the more then ordinary flouriſhing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the Saints even in their old age. I have read of an old Chriſtian, who being asked whether he grew in goodneſs or no, anſwered, I believe I do, becauſe the Lord has promiſed that his people ſhall bring forth fruit in old age. <hi>Pliny</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Crocodile, tells us, that ſhe grows to her dying day, ſo Chriſtians that are rooted in Chriſt, and planted in the houſe of the Lord, they will be ſtill growing up in grace and holineſs even to their dying day. 'Tis with real Chriſtians as 'tis with wine, the older the better, or as 'tis with the Sun which ſhines moſt gloriouſly and amiably when 'tis near ſeting. Gracious ſouls are like the Laurel (or the Bay-tree) whoſe leaves are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways green, not onely in the Summer of youth, but alſo in the Winter of old age.<note place="margin">Pliny.</note> The Palm-tree is always green, it never loſeth his leaves or fruit, and the more it is loaded the deeper it is rooted; and ſo it ſhall be with throughout Chriſtians. So in that <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.3, 4. God has promiſed to carry us on to old age. <hi>Hearken unto me, O houſe of Jacob, and all the remnant of the houſe of Iſrael, which are born by me, from the belly, which are carried from the womb. And even to your old age I am he, and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear, even I will carry and will deliver you.</hi> That God that begins a work of Grace and Holineſs in his peoples hearts, that God will perfect and carry on that work. Mothers and Nurſes expreſs their tender care, love, and delight, by carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Babes in their arms, till they can go alone; but God ſurpaſſes them in his love, care, tenderneſs, and divine fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:104351:251"/> for he will carry them even to hoary hairs. This word <hi>I,</hi> that is <hi>Six times</hi> repeated in <hi>verſe</hi> the fourth, is doubtleſs of very great importance, and ſignifies not onely Gods eternal Eſſence, and that he will be ever like himſelf, but alſo his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs in regard of us; for whatever our thoughts may be concerning God, yet we ſhall always find him one and the ſame, he will be as good to his people at laſt as he was at firſt, even to old age he will carry them. So in that <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.18. <hi>But the path of the juſt is as the ſhining light, that ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day.</hi> A holy man proceeds from grace to grace, from vertue to vertue; he goes from faith to faith, and from ſtrength to ſtrength, till at length he ſhines as the Sun in his ſtrength. So in that <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14.5, 6, 7. <hi>I will be as the due unto Iſrael: he ſhall grow as the Lilly, and caſt forth his root as Lebanon. His branches ſhall ſpread, and his beauty ſhall be as the Olive-tree, and his ſmell as Lebanon. They that dwell under his ſhaddow ſhall return, they ſhall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the ſcent thereof ſhall be as the wine of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon.</hi> The growth, the fruitfulneſs, and the flouriſhing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the Saints in grace and holineſs, is ſet forth by a ſeven-fold Metaphor in theſe words; the Similes are all plain and eaſie, and you may eaſily dilate upon them in your own thoughts; and therefore I ſhall paſs them. I ſhall conclude with that precious promiſe, <hi>John</hi> 4.14. <hi>But whoſoever drinketh of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt: but the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a well of water ſpringing up into everlaſting life.</hi> The Spirit in its gracious operations ſhall be a conſtant ſpring in believers hearts, and it ſhall every day riſe higher and higher, like the water in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezek. 47.1.—7.</note> till grace be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in glory. And thus you ſee by theſe choice promiſes, that 'tis poſſible for you to attain to a greater meaſure of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The prayers that have been put up upon this very account, do clearly evidence the ſame. Certainly the people <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of God would never have prayed for higher degrees of grace and holineſs, if they had not been attainable. Now 'tis very obſervable that the ſpirits of the Saints have run out much this way, as is evident in theſe inſtances, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9, 10, 11. <hi>And

For the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this argument, you muſt carefully diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Gods love of good Will, and his love of complacency; now Gods love of good Will is equall to all his Saints, whether they are rich or poore, high or low, bond or free, or whether they have a ſea of grace, or but a drop of grace; Gods love of good Will runs as much out to the weakeſt Chriſtian, as it do's to the ſtrongeſt, to a Babe in grace, as to a Gyant in grace.

Thus you ſee that Gods love of good will is equall in all his Saints, and therefore you are to underſtand this Argument of Gods love of compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; now this love runs out more to ſome Saints then it do's to others; for they that have much holineſs, are much beloved,<note place="margin">John 14.21, 23,</note> but they that have moſt holineſs, are moſt beloved; the greater thou art in holineſs, the greater wilt thou be beloved of God; <hi>O Daniel,</hi>

                        <hi>viz.</hi> that God loved the humanity of Chriſt more then any man, becauſe he was fuller of grace and truth then any man. Now for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> clearing up of this great Argument, Conſider, firſt, that the more holy any perſon is, the more excellent that perſon is. All corruptions are diminutions of excellency; the more mixt any thing is, the more abaſed it is; the more you mix your wine with water, the more you abaſe your wine, and the more you mix your Tin with Gold, the more you abaſe your Gold; but the purer your wine is, the richer and the better your wine is, and the purer your Gold is, the more glorious and excellent it is, ſo the purer and holier any perſon is, the more excellent and glorious that perſon is; Now the more divinely excellent and glorious any perſon is, the more he is beloved of God, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> more he is the delight of God. But ſecondly, the more holy any perſon is,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.5.</note> the more that perſon pleaſes the Lord; fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in holineſs fills heaven with joy. The Husbandman is not ſo much pleaſed with the fruitfulneſs of his fields, nor the wife with the fruitfulneſs of her womb, nor the father with the thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of his child, as God is pleaſed with the fruitfulneſs and thriving of his children in grace and holineſs; now certainly the more God is pleaſed with any perſon, the more he loves that perſon, and the more pleaſure and delight he takes in ſuch a perſon; if God be moſt pleaſed with holineſs, he cannot but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> be moſt delighted in thoſe that are moſt holy. But thirdly, the more holy any perſon is, the more like to God he is, and the more like to God he is, doubtleſs, the more he is beloved of God; 'tis likeneſs both in nature and grace that alwayes drawes the ſtrongeſt love. Though every child is the father multiplyed, the father of a ſecond edition, yet the father loves him beſt, and delights in him moſt, who is moſt like him, and who in feature, ſpirit, and action, do's moſt reſemble him to the life; and ſo do's the father of ſpirits alſo, he alwayes loves them beſt, who in holineſs reſemble him moſt. There are foure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable things in the beloved Diſciple above all the reſt. 1.<note place="margin">John 13.23. Ch. 18.16. Ch. 19.26. Verſ. 27.</note> That he lay neareſt to Chriſts Boſome at the Table. 2. That he followed Chriſt cloſeſt to the high Prieſts Palace. 3. That he ſtood cloſe to Chriſt when he was on the Croſs, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:104351:256"/> had baſely deſerted him, and turn'd their backs upon him. 4. That Chriſt commended the care of his virgin mother to him: Now why did Chriſts deſire, love, and delight, run out with a ſtronger and a fuller Tyde towards <hi>John,</hi> then to the reſt of the Diſciples, doubtleſs 'twas becauſe <hi>John</hi> did more reſemble Chriſt then the reſt, 'twas becauſe <hi>John</hi> was a more exact picture, and lively repreſentation of Chriſt then the others were. But, fourthly, the more holy any man is, the more communion and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> familiarity that man ſhall have with God; As you may ſee in <hi>Moſes, Moſes</hi> was a none-ſuch for meekneſs and holineſs. <hi>Num.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Now the man Moſes was very meeke, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.</hi> There was no man ſo ſlighted, wronged, provoked, teazed, perplexed, and troubled by that wicked, unthankful, unbelieving, and murmuring Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, and yet he did neither raile at them, nor revile them, he did neither ſtorme nor rage, he did neither fret nor fling, and though he had a ſword of Juſtice in his hand, and might eaſily have avenged himſelfe on them, yet he would not, but exerciſed all patience, tenderneſs, goodneſs and ſweetneſs towards them. O the lowlineſs, the meekneſs, the holineſs of this man <hi>Moſes!</hi> And O the freeneſs, the friendlineſs, the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the familiarneſs of God with <hi>Moſes!</hi> Deut. 34.10. <hi>And there aroſe not a Prophet ſince in Iſrael like unto Moſes, whom the Lord knew face to face.</hi> To give you a little light into theſe words; Some of the Rabbies obſerve that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſurpaſſed all the other Prophets, not only in ſublimity of Propheſies, but alſo in excellency and number of miracles; for <hi>Moſes</hi> within one Age wrought ſeventy ſix miracles, when all the reſt of the Prophets from the beginning of the world quite downe to the ruine of the firſt Temple, wrought only ſeventy foure: And as for thoſe words, <hi>whom the Lord knew face to face,</hi> you are not to underſtand them thus, that God hath a face as man hath, nor that <hi>Moſes</hi> had a view of the eſſence of God, which is inviſible;<note place="margin">John 1.18. 1 Tim. 6.16.</note> for in this ſenſe no man hath ſeen God at any time; and indeed the leaſt beame of Gods eſſentiall glory and Majeſtie would have ſwallowed up <hi>Moſes</hi> alive. But theſe words, <hi>whom the Lord knew face to face,</hi> are to be underſtood of Gods ſpeaking to <hi>Moſes</hi> in a free friendly familiar and plaine manner; God
<pb facs="tcp:104351:257"/> did ſpeak to <hi>Moſes</hi> by a cleare articulate voice, even as one man ſpeaks to another when they ſpeak face to face. And ſo when <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> were ſwell'd with pride and envy, and began to beſpatter <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to pick a hole in his Coat, and to cloud, eclipſe, and diminiſh his glory, ſee at what ahigh and noble rate God ſpeaks of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſee how God magnifies and exalts and lifts up <hi>Moſes</hi> in that 12 <hi>Num.</hi> 6, 7, 8. <hi>And he ſaid, heare now my words; if there be a Prophet among you, I the Lord will make my ſelf known unto him in a viſion, and will ſpeak unto him in a dreame. My ſervant Moſes is not ſo, who is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all my houſe; with him will I ſpeak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark ſpeeches; and the ſimilitude of the Lord ſhall he behold: Wherefore then were ye not-afraid to ſpeak againſt my ſervant Moſes?</hi> Now here you ſee how God owns <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſtands up for <hi>Moſes,</hi> and pleads for <hi>Moſes,</hi> and tells <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> to their faces, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt favourite, and that he had far greater reſpects for <hi>Moſes</hi> then he had for them, and that there was not a man in all the world that was ſo inward with him as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that had ſo much of his eare and heart as <hi>Moſes</hi> had. God did appeare to o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Some of the learned are of opinion, that Chriſt did converſe with <hi>Moſes</hi> in a humane ſhape, as he had done with <hi>Abraham</hi> before,<note place="margin">Gen. 18. &amp; Ch. 32.30. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> they conjecture that the Lord Jeſus did very friendly and familiarly ſhew himſelfe to <hi>Moſes</hi> with that very ſame face and forme of humane nature, which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards aſſumed; but this I dare not preſs upon you as an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of your faith: And whether <hi>Moſes</hi> had one hundred and ſeventy three familiar conferences with God, which none of the
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:104351:257"/> Prophets had, lyes upon thoſe Rabbies to prove that doe aſſert it; but this is granted on all hands, that he was a ſpeciall favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and a man in high communion with God, and one that had very cleare and eminent diſcoveries and manifeſtations of God. And ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> was a man of great holineſs, and a man emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in his communion with God, God own'd him as a friend,<note place="margin">Iſa. 41.8.</note> as an honorable friend, as an eminent friend, as a boſome friend, as a peculiar friend, and as a faithful friend, and therefore he made him one of his Privy Councell, and open'd his heart and his ſecrets to him: <hi>And the Lord ſaid, ſhall I hide from Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham the thing which I doe?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 18.17.</note> 
                        <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſtil'd the friend of God by a ſpecialty, though God had many friends, yet 'twas <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> that was his ſingular friend, his darling friend, his rare friend, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and accordingly, God was moſt free, and full, and rich in the communications of his favours, and ſecrets to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> 'twas not enough for <hi>Abraham</hi> to be of Gods Court, but he muſt be alſo of his Cabinet Councell. 'Twas alwayes a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in morality, that ſweet and intimate friendſhip cannot be extended to many; Friends uſually goe by paires. And thus you ſee that the more holy any man is, the more communion that man ſhall have with God, and the more communion any man has with God, the more beloved ſhall that man be of God; the higheſt communion is alwayes attended with the higheſt love. But,</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, the more holy any man is, the more actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ripe and fit for heaven that man is.

Well, for a cloſe of this Argument, remember this, that as the Sun ſhines hotter on ſome Climates, then it doth upon others, and as the dew falls more upon one place then another, and as the water over-flowes ſome paſtures more then others; ſo Gods love of complacency and delight, ſhines hotter and brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon ſome Chriſtians, then it do's upon others; and theſe I have ſhew'd you to be ſuch who are moſt eminent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in grace and holineſs.

What will men ſay, when they ſhall behold your eminency in ſanctity? will they not ſay, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God is no hard Maſter,<note place="margin">Math. 25.24.</note> he never looks to reape where he do's not ſowe, nor to gather where he do's not ſtraw; Certainly, he keeps a noble houſe, his Tables are richly ſpread, his Cups overflow, he feeds, yea he feaſts his ſervants with the choiceſt rarities and varieties that heaven affords, witneſs their thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and flouriſhing eſtate in grace and holineſs. And thus you ſee that the more your holineſs is encreaſed, the more highly the God of heaven will be exalted and magnified. But,</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, To provoke you to endeavour after higher degrees <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of holineſs, Conſider, that the more holineſs thou haſt, the more hee'l give thee. At firſt God gives holineſs where there is none; and where this holineſs is improved, there God will be ſtill aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting and increaſing of it; do thou but make it thy buſineſs to perfect holineſs in the feare of the Lord,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.7.</note> and the Lord will not faile to make new and freſh additions of more grace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to that thou haſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. <hi>The Lord will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.</hi> Mark thoſe words, viz. <hi>that the Lord will give grace and glory,</hi> that is, grace unto glory, hee'l ſtill be adding more grace to that thou haſt, till the bud of grace be turn'd into the
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:104351:259"/> flower of glory, till thy grace on earth commenceth glory in heaven; the more holineſs any man has, the more ſtill God will give him. <hi>Math.</hi> 13.12. <hi>For whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundance:</hi> He that hath princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of grace and holineſs laid into his ſoul, he ſhall finde a plentifull increaſe of thoſe ſanctifying and ſaving principles; he ſhall have more abundance; his ſpark of holineſs ſhall grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a flame, his drops of holineſs ſhall be turn'd into a ſea, and his mite of holineſs ſhall be multiplyed into millions.<note place="margin">Math. 25.29.</note> The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter harveſt of holineſs a Chriſtian brings forth, the greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of holineſs ſhall he experience; every exerciſe of grace and holineſs is alwayes attended with new increaſe of grace and holineſs. Look as that arme is greateſt and ſtrongeſt that is moſt uſed and exerciſed; ſo that particular grace that is moſt exerciſed and uſed, is moſt ſtrengthned and greatned. Look as earthly Parents when they ſee their children to husband and improve a little Stock to great advantage, then they adde to their Stock, they increaſe their Stock, they double their Stock; ſo when the father of ſpirits ſees his children to husband and improve a little Stock of grace and holineſs to the great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their ſouls, then he will increaſe their ſpiritual Stock, he will be ſtill a adding to their Stock, yea he will double their Stock. <hi>John</hi> 15.2. <hi>Every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</hi> Such as are fruitful, ſhall be made more fruitful: Chriſt will take moſt paines to make them better, who are already very good; of all Chriſtians in the world, there are none that have ſo much grace as humble Chriſtians have, and yet God delights to pour in grace into their ſouls, as men pour liquor into empty veſſels; humility is both a grace,<note place="margin">James 4.6.</note> and a veſſel to receive more grace. And thus much for this fifth Argument. But,</p>
                     <p> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, To provoke you to labour after higher degrees of holineſs, Conſider, that the more holineſs you attaine to, the greater will be your heaven of joy and comfort in this world. Though the leaſt ſpark of true holineſs will bring a man to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, certainly yet 'tis only an eminency in holineſs that will make a man walk to heaven comfortably; the more holineſs any man has,<note place="margin">Pſal. 16. <hi>ult.</hi>
                        </note> the more he ſhall enjoy him, in whoſe preſence is fulneſs
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:104351:259"/> of joy; and the more any man enjoyes the preſence of God with his Spirit, the greater will be his heaven of joy in this world. Look as a little Star yeilds but a little light, ſo a little holineſs yeilds but a little comfort; and look as the greateſt Stars yeilds the greateſt light, ſo the greateſt meaſures of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs alwayes yeilds the greateſt comforts: Divine joy ebbs and flowes as holineſs ebbs and ſlowes; ſoul comforts riſes and falls as holineſs riſes and falls. Great meaſures of holineſs carries with them the greateſt evidence of the reality of holineſs; now the more clearely and evidently the reality and ſincerity of a mans holineſs appeares, the higher will the ſprings of joy and comfort ariſe in his ſoul: Great meaſures of holineſs carry with them the greateſt evidence of a mans union and communion with God; and the more evident a mans union and communion is with God, the more will that mans ſoul be fill'd with that joy that is unſpeakable and full of glory:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.8. Acts 9.31.</note> In great meaſures of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a man may ſee and reade moſt of the love of God, the face of God, the favour of God, and the heart of God; and the more a man is bleſt with ſuch a ſight as this is, the more will that Babe of grace, divine joy, ſpring in his ſoul: The greater meaſures of holineſs and ſanctification any man attaines to, the clearer and brighter will the evidences of his Juſtification be;<note place="margin">Rom. 5.1, 2, 3. And Ch. 8.30, 33, 34, 35,</note> Now the clearer evidences any man has of his Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſtronger will be his conſolation; and indeed the ſtrongeſt waters of conſolation, doe alwayes flow from a cleare ſight and a true ſenſe of a mans juſtification; no man lives ſo comfortably, no man bares the croſs ſo ſweetly, no man reſiſts the devill and the world ſo ſtoutly, nor no man will die ſo chearfully, as he that lives and dies in a cleare ſight of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification: The more holineſs any man attaines to, the more his feares will be ſcattered, his doubts reſolved, and all thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments removed that commonly bar out joy and comfort? and what will be the happy iſſue of theſe things, but the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of a ſea of joy and comfort into the ſoul? 'Tis not riches, nor honors, nor applauſe, nor learning, nor friends, nor a great name in the world, but an eminency in holineſs that can highly raiſe the ſprings of divine joy in a Chriſtians ſoul. Though the windowes of the Temple were broad without but narrow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:104351:260"/> yet the joy and comfort of a Chriſtian (that is eminent in holineſs) is broad and full within, though it be narrow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted without. O Sirs, as ever you would have your joy full, labour for a heart fill'd with holineſs; your comforts will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes few and low, if your holineſs be low. Why have the Angels alwayes Harpes in their hands, and Hallelujah's in their mouths, but becauſe they have attain'd to a fulneſs of holineſs. But,</p>

Some of the Ancients are of opinion, that he ſaw Gods eſſence; for, ſay they, other things in heaven might have been uttered, but the eſſence of God is ſo great, and ſo glorious a thing, that no man or Angel can utter it, or declare it; but here I muſt crave leave to enter my diſſent,
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:104351:260"/> for the Scripture is expreſs in this,<note place="margin">John 1.18. 1 Tim. 6.16. 1 Ioh. 4.12.</note> that no man hath thus ever ſeen the Lord at any time; and that no man can thus ſee the Lord and live: And as great a favourite of heaven as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, yet he could only ſee the back parts of God, he could on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behold ſome lower repreſentations of God. Others ſay, that he heard the heavenly ſinging of Angels and bleſſed Spirits, which was ſo ſweet, ſo excellent and glorious, that no mortall man was able to utter it, and this of the two is moſt probable, but no man is bound to make this opinion an Article of his faith; this I think we may ſafely conclude, that in this rapture, beſides the contemplation of Celeſtial Myſteries, he felt ſuch unſpeakable delight and pleaſure, that was either like to that or exceeding that which <hi>Adam</hi> took in the terreſtrial Paradiſe; doubtleſs, the Apoſtle did ſee and heare ſuch excellent and glorious things, as was impoſſible for the tongue of any mortal man to expreſs or utter. And ſo <hi>John</hi> was a man of moſt rare holineſs, and Chriſt reveals to him the General eſtate of his Church, and all that ſhould befall his people, and that from <hi>Johns</hi> time unto his ſecond coming: Chriſt gives <hi>John</hi> a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of all the troubles, tryalls, changes, mercies and glories, that in all times, and in all Ages and places, ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his Church, untill he came in all his glory.

<pb n="517" facs="tcp:104351:269"/> ſo the increaſe of holineſs, the thriving, the fruitfulneſs of ſouls in holineſs, adds to the credit and comfort, to the pleaſure and delight, to the joy and reward of faithful painful Miniſters, who are Nurſes, Husbandmen, and Shepherds, in the language of the holy Scriptures. Though it be true, that faithful Miniſters are a ſweet ſavour to God, both in them that are ſaved,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.15.</note> and in them that periſh, though their labour whether it hit or miſs is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſhall be rewarded of the Lord,<note place="margin">Iſa. 49.45.</note> (as the Phyſitian has his Fee, though the patient dies, &amp; the Nurſe has her wages, though the child don't thrive, and the Vine-dreſſer has his hire, though the Vines don't bare fruit) yet the more they win men to heaven, and the more by their means the work of holineſs is carried on in the hearts &amp; lives of men, the weightier will be their crowne of glory, and the greater will be their joy and rejoycing in the great day of our Lord.

But,</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, To provoke you to labour after higher degrees of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, conſider, that the more holineſs you have here, the more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> happineſs you ſhall have hereafter; the more grace you have on earth, the more glory you ſhall have in heaven.

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, That the beatifical viſion ſhall be ſeen by all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Saints, and communicated to all the Saints, they ſhall all have a

The far Countrey that he is gone to is heaven, for thither he went at his aſcenſion; now when he ſhall returne from heaven to judge the quick &amp; the dead, he will then bring men to an account, to a reckoning about their improvement of all the gifts and graces that he has intruſted them with, and according to the different improvement that men ſhall make of their Talents, ſo ſhall be their reward; he that makes the greateſt improvement of his pound, he ſhall have the greateſt reward, he ſhall be Ruler over ten Cities, that is, he ſhall be very highly honored and exalted, and he that makes a leſſer improvement, he ſhall have a leſſer reward, he ſhall be Ruler over five Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; he that makes a great improvement of a little, he ſhall, if I may ſo ſpeak, ſit at Chriſts right hand, but he that makes a leſſer improvement, he muſt be contented to ſit at Chriſts left hand.

And thou Capernaum, which art exalted up to Heaven, ſhalt bee brought down to Hell; for if the mighty works which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</hi> The more mercy hath been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bare knee intreating ſinners to repent; the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt the Lord Jeſus hath been in wooing ſinners to beleeve on him, and to reſign up themſelves wholly and only to him, the more clearly and ſweetly the everlaſting Goſpel hath ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſinners ears, and the more neer, and the more often
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:104351:275"/> Heaven hath been brought to ſinners doors, and yet they have bid defiance to all, and hardened themſelves in their ſins, with the greater violence, and with the more dreadful vengeance, ſhall ſuch be plunged into the loweſt Hell. And ſo in that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.14. <hi>Woe unto you Scribes, Phariſees, and Hypocrites, for yee devour Widdows houſes, and for a pretence make long prayer; therefore yee ſhall receive the greater damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Hypocrites ſhall bee double-damned, the hotteſt and the darkeſt place in Hell is reſerved for them. Give him his portion with hypocrites; for number and weight there are no torments in Hell to the torments of hypocrites. Counterfeit ſanctity is double iniquity, and therefore 'tis but juſtice that the hypocrite ſhould have double torment. And ſo in that, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.47, 48. <hi>That ſervant that knows his Masters will, and doth it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes, and hee that knew it not, and did commit things worthy of ſtripes, ſhall bee beaten with few ſtripes.</hi> Sins againſt light and knowledge, are ſins againſt the nobleſt remedy; they waſte and wound the conſcience moſt; they moſt open ſinners mouths to blaſpheme God, and they moſt harden ſinners hearts in ſinning againſt God; and every way they dare God moſt, and provoke God moſt to ſtrike with an Iron-Rod, and to whip the knowing tranſgreſſor, not with Rods, but with Scorpions. 'Tis very obſervable, that the more light and knowledge men ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt in this world,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.21, 22, 23.</note> the greater judgements God gives them up to, even in this life; take a remarkable inſtance in the moſt refined and civil Heathens (who are preſumed to have moſt light and knowledge) who were given up to the moſt beaſtly errours about the nature of God, as the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> who worſhipped Feavers, and humane paſſions, yea every paltry thing, &amp;c. whereas the <hi>Scythians,</hi> and more barbarous Nations worſhipped the Sun, and the Thunder, &amp;c. things terrible in themſelves. Oh how much more then will God in the great day give them up to the greateſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who have given themſelves up to the greateſt ſins! Certainly the Profeſſors of this age, yea of this City, whether they go to Heaven or Hell, will be the greateſt debtors that ſhall be in either place; the one to the Free-grace of God,
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:104351:275"/> and the other to his Juſtice; that they that have moſt of Hell in their mouths, and moſt of Hell in their hearts, and moſt of Hell in their lives, ſhould have moſt of Hell in their ſouls at laſt, is but juſtice. I ſhall conclude this ſecond Argument with a ſaying of one of the Antients;<note place="margin">Augustin.</note> Look (ſaith hee) as in Heaven one is more glorious than another, ſo in Hell one ſhall be more miſerable than another. Now if there be degrees of torments in Hell (which I ſuppoſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures but now cited doth undeniably prove) then doubtleſs there will be degrees of glory in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, God in this life diſpenſes the gifts and graces of his Spirit unequally among his Saints; to ſome hee gives two Talents, to others five, and to others ten. Hence 'tis you read both of a weak Faith, and of a ſtrong Faith.<note place="margin">Matth. 25. and ch. 8.10, 26. &amp; ch. 15.28.</note> 
                        <hi>Why are yee afraid, O yee of little Faith?</hi> And, <hi>O woman great is thy Faith.</hi> And, <hi>Verily I have not found ſo great Faith, no not in Iſrael.</hi> And hence it is that you read both of weak Chriſtians, and of ſtrong Chriſtians. <hi>Hee that is weak in the Faith, receive.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 14.1, 2. 1 Cor. 9.22. 2 Cor. 12.10. Heb. 5.13, 14 1 Pet. 2.2. v. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who is weak eateth herbs. And to the weak, I became as weak, that I might win the weak. Wee then that are ſtrong, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to pleaſe our ſelves. When I am weak, then am I ſtrong.</hi> And hence 'tis that you read of Babes, and of Children, and of young Men, and of old Men, in the Scripture. Saints are of different growths. Some are but babes in gifts and grace, others are children, others young men, and others old men. That God that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributes the good things of this world unequally among the Sons of men, as to ſome more, to others leſs; to ſome great things, to others little things; to ſome high things, to others low things; that God unequally diſtributes ſpiritual bleſſings among his deareſt children; to ſome hee gives more light, to others leſs; to ſome a greater meaſure of love, to others a leſs; to ſome a greater degree of joy, to others a leſs, &amp;c. Some Saints ſhine in grace and holineſs as the Firmament, and others ſhine in grace and holineſs as the Stars; ſome ſhine in grace and holineſs as the Moon, and others ſhine in grace and holineſs as the Sun, and all this ſprings from thoſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent meaſures of grace and holineſs, that God beſtows upon
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:104351:276"/> his people. Now doubtleſs men may as well plead for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual degrees of grace, as they may for equal degrees of glory; they may as well plead for an equal ſhare in the good things of this world, as they may plead for an equal ſhare in the happineſs and bleſſedneſs of that other world. Doubtleſs as God diſpenſes his gifts and graces unequally in this life, ſo hee will diſpenſe his Rewards unequally in the other life. As mens gifts and graces are different here on earth, ſo their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall be different when they come to Heaven; without all peradventure they ſhall have the whiteſt and the largeſt Robes of Honour, and the heavieſt and the brighteſt Crowns of Glory; whoſe ſouls are moſt richly adorned with grace, and whoſe lives are moſt eminently beſpangled with holineſs. The more grace and holineſs any Saint hath here, the more hee is prepared and fitted for glory, and the more any Saint is fitted for glory, the more that Saint ſhall at laſt be filled with glory. The greateſt meaſures of grace &amp; holineſs do moſt inlarge the ſoul, and widen the ſoul, and capacitate the ſoul, to take in the greateſt meaſures of glory; and therefore the more grace, the more glory; the more holineſs the more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs a Saint ſhall have at laſt. Certainly God will crown his own gracious works in his children, proportionable to what they are, but they are different and unequally in all his children (in reſpect of meaſures and degrees) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God will ſet different Crowns of glory upon the heads of his children at laſt. But</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, They that have more grace and holineſs than others, they are more like to God than others. They bear his glorious Image in a greater print, they have a brighter cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of God upon them, and they are the moſt lively pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of God in all the world.</p>
                     <p>Now wee know, though Parents love their children well, and wiſh all their children well, and do for all their Children well, yet commonly they love them moſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them beſt that reſemble them moſt. Parents cannot but love thoſe children moſt, and lay up for them moſt, who have moſt of themſelves in them; and I cannot ſee how God can do otherwiſe than love them moſt, and provide for them
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:104351:276"/> beſt, who moſt reſembled him to the life; the nature of God is a holy nature, and ſo there lies a holy neceſſity on his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to love them moſt who have moſt grace and holineſs in them; look as tis natural to God to hate wickedneſs,<note place="margin">Pſal. 45.7.</note> ſo tis natural to God to love holineſs; and as the higher men riſe in wickedneſs, the more a holy God hates them; ſo the higher men riſe in holineſs, the more a holy God loves them; now the more any are like to God, and the more they are beloved of God, the higher doubtleſs in glory ſhall they bee advanced by God. The beſt and the largeſt Portion is laid up for that Childe that is moſt like his Father; the more any man in holineſs reſembles God on Ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Fiftly, and laſtly; to deny degrees of glory in Heaven, and to ſay that God won't ſute mens wages to their works, nor their rewards to their ſervices, nor crown the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of grace with the higheſt degrees of glory, is to render uſeleſs, many glorious exhortations, that are ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered up and down in the Scripture; as that in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. <hi>Therefore my beloved Brethren, bee yee ſtedfaſt, unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, alwaies abounding in the work of the Lord, for aſmuch as you know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi> If this were not a truth, that I have been all this while aſſerting, why then, when men meet with this exhortation, they may ſay, why, tis no great matter whether we are ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, and alwaies abounding in the work of the Lord or no, for if wee are, wee ſhall never advance our reward in Heaven, wee ſhall never add Pearls to our glorious Crown, wee ſhall never add one mite to our happineſs and bleſſedneſs: and if wee are not, wee ſhall bee as high in Heaven, and our reward as great, and our crown as weighty, as theirs ſhall bee who are ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, &amp; alwaies abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the work of the Lord. And ſo the denyal of degrees of glory in Heaven, will take off alſo the edge of all thoſe other exhortations of perfecting holineſs, of ſowing liberally,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7 1. cap. 9.6. 2 Pet. 3. ult. Joh. 15.8. 2 Pet 1.5, 6, 7.</note> of growing in grace, of bringing forth much fruit, and of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vertue to vertue, &amp;c. yea, this will cut the throat of
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:104351:277"/> all divine endeavours, for who will labour to bee rich in grace, and to bee much in ſervice, and to abound in all the fruits of righteouſneſs and holineſs, when none of all this will turn to a mans advantage in another world? If hee that ſows little, ſhall have as great a Harveſt, as hee that ſows much, if hee that is dull and negligent in the work of the Lord, ſhall have as great a reward, as hee that is active and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in the work of the Lord. If thoſe trees of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which bring forth much fruit, ſhall have no greater a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, than thoſe trees of righteouſneſs which bring forth many leaves (of profeſſion) but little fruit, &amp;c. who would ſow much, and who would bee active, and abundant in the work of the Lord? and who would bring forth much fruit, verily but few, if any. But now the opinion or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the truth, that I have been labouring to make good, <hi>viz.</hi> that there ſhall bee different degrees of glory in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that God will proportion mens reward to their work, and that he will meaſure out happineſs and bleſſedneſs to them at laſt, according to the different meaſures of grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon his people, and according to the work, ſervice, and faithfulneſs of his people, in this world. This truth I ſay held forth in its luſter and glory, is a marvellous incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, and a mighty provocation to all ſincere Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to labour after the higheſt pitches in Chriſtianity, and to bee very eminent in grace and holineſs; for what man is there that will not reaſon thus, the more grace the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the more holineſs the more happineſs, the more work the more wages, and the greater my ſervice ſhall bee here, the greater ſhall bee my reward hereafter; and therefore, O my Soul! grow in grace, perfect holineſs, and abound in the work and ſervice of the Lord, knowing <hi>that thy labour ſhall not bee in vain in the Lord:</hi> And thus I have given you the reaſons, that prove that there ſhall bee degrees of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Now I have nothing further to do upon this point, but to give a few brief Anſwers, to ſuch Objections, as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly raiſed againſt this truth, that I have aſſerted and proved.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> Firſt, Some object and ſay, that one Chriſt bought us all, and that all our portions are bought by the precious blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and that therefore all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers ſhall ſhare alike in the inheritance of the Saints in light; now to this Objection I ſhall Anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That all Saints ſhall bee equal ſharers, in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial, and eſſential glory of Heaven, &amp;c. but of this I have ſpoken before: and therefore,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Though a Father buyes a rich inheritance for all his Children, yet this laies no neceſſity nor obligation at all upon him, to alot to every one of his Children an equal portion? ſo though our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, hath by his blood purchaſed a rich inheritance for his Children, yet this layes no neceſſity nor obligation at all upon Jeſus Chriſt, to divide this rich inheritance, by equal portions among his Children; tis true, that Chriſt hath purchaſed all with his blood, and tis as true, that hee may divide his purchaſe among his people as hee pleaſes; if every man may do with his own as hee pleaſeth why may not Chriſt, muſt hee needs bee bound when others are free?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, I anſwer, that as it is true that the merits and ſatisfaction of Chriſt, is the ground and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our reward, and that alone which makes our works capable of a reward; ſo tis as true, that our works are the ſubject of reward, and this is moſt agreeable to the compact that was made between Chriſt and his Father; that everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happineſs and bleſſedneſs, that eternal glory and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould bee meaſured out to the Saints, according to their different meaſures of grace, and different degrees of ſervice that they have been engaged in, in this world; and all this upon the credit of Chriſts blood; certainly there is nothing under heaven below the blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt that can make differing works, capable of a different reward: the Papiſts are moſt ſadly out, for they are ſo blinde and bold as to affirm that the more grace any man hath, the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hee merits by his grace, theſe men make degrees of grace and not the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, to be the meritorious cauſe of degrees of glory, and therefore of all men I think they are
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:104351:278"/> furtheſt from glory: certainly this is the beleevers glory, and his crown of rejoycing that all recompences and rewards ſhall flow in upon him, not upon the account of his merits, but upon the account of Chriſts blood, and thus much ſhall ſuffice, to have ſpoken by way of Anſwer to this Objection.</p>

                        <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. But now in the Second place, I ſhall come to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their grand and main objection, and that is taken from that Parable in the 20 <hi>Matth.</hi> where the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is compared to a vineyard; now in this Parable there is mention made of a Husband-man that call'd ſeveral labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers into his vineyard, at ſeveral hours in the day, ſome hee call'd at the firſt hour, and ſome hee call'd at the third, and ſome at the ninth, and ſome at the eleventh, now when they came all to receive their wages, the ſtory tells us that hee gave every man a penny, hee gave every man an equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, they that laboured from the firſt hour, and they that laboured from the third hour, and they that laboured from the ſixth hour of the day, had no greater a recompence than hee that came in at the eleventh hour, and ſo had labour'd but one hour in the vineyard, and bore but little, if any, of the heat of the day, from whence the Objectors conclude that there are no degrees of glory in Heaven; but that all ſhall have glory alike, happineſs and bleſſedneſs alike, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man ſhall have his penny, every man ſhall have an equal reward, and no mans penny in Heaven ſhall bee brighter or bigger than anothers.</p>
                     <p>Now by way of anſwer, to this objection, give mee leave to premiſe theſe three things?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That this Parable of the houſholder, in giving to every man a penny, hath no reference at all to Heaven, nor to the reward, nor to the glory that ſhall bee confer'd upon the Elect, and this I ſhall clearly and fully prove, by theſe four following Arguments.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, This illative particle, <hi>for,</hi> in <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. ſheweth that this Parable is inſerted to expound the former concluſion, <hi>viz. that the firſt ſhall bee laſt, and the laſt ſhall bee firſt,</hi> and therefore the end of the Parable is concluded, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the ſame ſentence, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>the laſt ſhall bee firſt,
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:104351:278"/> and the firſt ſhall be laſt.</hi> Chriſt by this Parable would teach his hearers, that there is no reaſon under Heaven why they which are firſt called in reſpect of time ſhould boaſt or triumph over others, becauſe hee can eaſily call the uncalled at pleaſure, and either make them equal with them, or elſe prefer them before them which are firſt. The ſcope of Chriſt in this Parable is not to ſet forth the equality of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial glory, 'tis not to prove that the happineſs and bleſſedneſs of the Saints ſhall be equal in Heaven, but the very drift of the Parable is to ſhew, that they which are firſt called and converted, have no cauſe at all to deſpiſe the uncalled, &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, or to trample upon them with the foot of pride, conſidering that they who are yet in their ſins, and in their blood, and in an unconverted, and unſanctified eſtate, may yet be called, and either made equal to them, or preferred before them. But</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Interpreters do generally agree in this, that by the Husbandman wee are to underſtand God himſelf, and by the Labourers men upon earth, and by the Vineyard the Church of God; and ſeveral of them ſay,<note place="margin">Chryſoſtom, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, Jerom, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, Austin.</note> that by the five hours in the Parable, wee are to underſtand the five ages of man.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By thoſe who were called in the morning,<note place="margin">See my Apples of Gold.</note> and ſent into the Vineyard, wee are to underſtand thoſe who in their childhood are called and converted, they are ſuch who begin to ſeek the Lord, and to ſerve the Lord, even as ſoon as they are capable of the uſe of reaſon; As <hi>Samuel</hi> did, and as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> did, and as <hi>Timothy</hi> did.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, By thoſe who are called at the third hour, wee are to underſtand thoſe who are converted, and turned to the Lord in their youth, in the prime, the ſpring and morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their daies.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, By thoſe who were called at the ſixth hour, wee are to underſtand thoſe who are turned to the Lord in their ſtrength, and in their full and perfect age.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, By thoſe who were called at the ninth hour, wee are to underſtand thoſe who are converted and turned to the Lord in their declining age.</p>
                     <pb n="568" facs="tcp:104351:279"/>
                     <p>And fifthly, By thoſe who were called at the eleventh hour, wee are to underſtand thoſe who are converted and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Lord in their decrepit old age, when they have one foot in the grave, and there is but a ſhort ſtep between them and eternity; when with the Theef upon the croſſe they are even ready to bee turned off of the Ladder of life. Now the Vineyard being the Church, all that this parable proveth is no more but this, that whether men are cal'd into the Vineyard of the Church either ſooner or later; either at the firſt hour, or at the ninth, or eleventh hour. Yet this ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greaten nor leſſen their reward, for if they are called at the firſt hour, their recompence ſhall bee never the greater upon that account, or if they are called at the eleventh hour, their reward ſhall be never the leſſer upon that account; the reward ſhall not bee different according to the different times of mens being called and converted, and that this Parable proves; but the reward ſhall bee different according to the diverſity of our works, and that my former arguments prove. But,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If the Penny<note place="margin">The <hi>Roman</hi> penny is the eight part of an ounce, which after five ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings the ounce, is ſeven pence half penny.</note> that every one had in the Parable be meant of glory, then it will roundly follow, that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers ſhall be ſaved, and glorified as well as others, for the murmurers had their Penny as well as the reſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10, 11, 12. <hi>But when the firſt came, they ſuppoſed that they ſhould have received more, and they likewiſe received every man a Penny. And when they had received it, they murmured against the good man of the houſe, ſaying, Theſe laſt have wrought but one hour, and thou haſt made them equal unto us, which have born the burden, and heat of the day.</hi> The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> there; in Heaven all the veſſels of Glory ſhall be full, and there ſhall not be the leaſt ſhadow of envy, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:104351:279"/> there. In the ſtreets of that new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above, none ſhall ever complain that others have too much, or that themſelves have too little; every glorified Saint ſhall ſit down fully ſatisfied and contented with his portion there. Now ſhould wee by the Penny underſtand a glorified eſtate and condition, then this would unavoidably follow, that many ſhall be brought to a ſtate of glory, which are not e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lected, nor ſanctified nor prepared for glory; but this can never, nor muſt never be granted; and therefore without all peradventure this Parable doth no way hold out that ſtate of glory and felicity which all the called and choſen of God, ſhall have at Chriſts coming to judge the quick and the dead. But</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Penny that is here mentioned in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, cannot, nor may not be interpreted, ſo as to ſignifie an equality of glory, or an equality of happineſs and bleſſedneſs, that the Saints ſhall have in Heaven, becauſe ſuch an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, ſuch an expoſition is croſs and contrary to the common and received Rules of interpreting and expounding of Scripture. Now among other Rules that are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the interpreting and expounding of Scripture, there are theſe two.</p>
                     <p>Firſt. You muſt ſo interpret and expound one Text of Scripture, that you do not ſet it at ſtrife and variance with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Text of Scripture; for though there is a ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction between Scripture and Scripture, yet there is a bleſſed harmony, and a glorious correſpondency between all the parts of Scripture, 'Tis a very dangerous thing ſo to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret Scripture, as to raiſe conteſts and oppoſition between Scriptures and Scriptures; 'tis an evil thing to raiſe up Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture againſt Scripture, and ſo to interpret one as to make it affront another. Woe to him that by his interpretations of Scripture proclaims the Scriptures to be at open war amongſt themſelves. Now to interpret the Penny in the Parable, ſo as to make it ſignifie an equality of glory and happineſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Saints in Heaven, is to ſet this Scripture at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, and ſtrife, withall thoſe Scriptures that I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to prove an inequality in the glory and happineſs of
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:104351:280"/> the Saints in Heaven, and therefore ſuch an interpretation is rather to be abhorred, than to be received. But</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Another Rule that is to be obſerved in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting of Scripture, is this, wee muſt alwaies interpret thoſe Scrptures that are more dark and myſterious by thoſe Scriptures that are more plain and clear, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret thoſe Scriptures that are plain and clear, by thoſe that are dark and myſterious,<note place="margin">Job 38.2.</note> for this were to darken counſel by words without knowledge. Now they that interpret the Penny in the Parable to ſignifie an equality of glory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Saints in Heaven; they tranſgreſs this ſecond Rule; for they muſt then interpret all thoſe clear and plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that I have brought to prove degrees of glory in Heaven by this dark and myſterious Parable, whereas they ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret this dark and myſterious Parable (if I may ſo ſay) by thoſe plain and clear Scriptures that I have already cited; and therefore their interpretation muſt be rejected. 'Tis true, of ſome Parables wee may ſay as <hi>Gregory</hi> doth, <hi>viz.</hi> That they rather require a Practicer, than an Interpreter. And 'tis as true,<note place="margin">Pſal. 49.4. &amp; Pſal. 78.2. John 16.29.</note> that other Parables are ſo dark, obſcure, and myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that wee ſhall never underſtand them, without the ſweat of our brows, and the beating of our brains; and ſuch a Parable this ſeems to be, and therefore wee muſt interpret the parts of it rather by other clear Scriptures, than to make clear and plain Scriptures bow to this that ſeems to have a vail upon it. And thus you ſee by theſe Arguments that the Penny in the Parable hath no reference at all to Heaven, nor to any equality of glory that ſhall be among the Saints there.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s<note place="margin">Vide Chriſoſtom in hunc locum.</note> counſel on the Text ſhould be eyed and followed, ſaith hee, Wee ſhould not ſtrain every particular of a Parable, but only conſider the ſcope of Chriſt in the propounding of it, and accordingly apply it. Wee look not on every particular colour in a well drawn picture, but on the whole peice: ſo when wee come to view a Parable, 'tis enough that wee caſt our eye principally upon the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral intention and ſcope of it; hee that is very exact and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to view and obſerve every particular circumſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:104351:280"/> Parables, may eaſily draw blood inſtead of milk out of the breaſts of Parables.<note place="margin">Ezek. 2.10. <hi>Hier. in cap.</hi> 2. Ezek.</note> Parables are like to the Role which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaw in a Viſion ſpread before him, which was written within and without; without the Hiſtory was written, and within the myſtery was written. Now though the out-ſide, the hiſtory of a Parable be like the Golden Pot, yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, the myſtery of a Parable, is like the <hi>Manna</hi> that was hid therein, and 'tis the <hi>Manna,</hi> the <hi>Manna,</hi> that wee muſt ſeek after. Look, as 'tis their wiſdome, who deal in curious rich ſtuffs that are wrought on both ſides, to caſt a ſpecial eye upon the flowers that are on the inſide of thoſe ſtuffs: So 'tis our wiſdome to caſt a ſpecial eye upon the inſide of Parables, upon the myſtical reference that Parables have, than to lye poring upon the outſide of Parables. Now the ſcope of this Parable is not to prove that there is an equality of glory in Heaven, but to reprove the <hi>Jews,</hi> who being called into the Lords Vineyard betimes in the morning, repined and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured that the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were called in at the latter end of the day, who were called in ſome thouſand years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, that they ſhould through the riches of grace have an equal ſhare with them in the reward; and ſtand upon as good and as noble terms with God as themſelves, who had ſo long bore the heat of the day. God, to ſhew that his gifts, his grace, and his rewards are free, will give his pennies as well to thoſe who have laboured but a little, as to thoſe who have laboured much; and this is no prejudice at all to his truth and juſtice, that his grace is free. But</p>
                     <p>Thirdly and laſtly; That by the Penny wee cannot, nor wee may not underſtand everlaſting happineſs and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but ſome other reward that Hypocrites may attain to as well as ſincere-hearted-Chriſtians, and the reaſon is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for hee that was ſent away for his envious grumbling and grunting, was ſent away alſo with his Penny;<note place="margin">Some by the Penny do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, worldly honour, and the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of men.</note> take thy Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and be packing. By the Penny ſome pious Interpreters do underſtand ſome competent gift or other (whatever it were) which might be well managed and improved to advantage. The Vineyard is the Church, and every one that is called to labour in the Vineyard, is called to labour in the uſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:104351:281"/> of Ordinances. Now every one that is laborious in the uſe of Ordinances, ſhall be ſure to get ſomething; no man ſhall kindle a fire on Gods Altar for nought. And yet it many times comes to paſs, that thoſe who have been called and converted long before others, do yet make no greater, nor no better yearnings on it, than thoſe do that have been called and converted long after them; hee that is called at the firſt hour ſometimes gets no more than hee that is called at the eleventh hour. 'Tis in the Trade of Chriſtianity, as it is in other Trades. Now you know that many men who have been ſet up in this or that Trade, ten, nay twenty years before others, yet they many times make no more yearnings, no more advantage of their Trade, than they that have ſet up but the other day, as wee ſay. Why ſo many that have been called long to the Trade of Chriſtianity before others, yet they make no more yearnings, no more advantage of that Trade, than thoſe that have been called to it but yeſterday, as I may ſpeak; his gifts, his gain, his yearnings that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in at the eleventh hour of the day, is many times equal to his that was called in at the firſt hour of the day. Yea I have formerly proved, that ſometimes many that are called later than others, do yet in gifts and grace excel thoſe that were called long before them. Now theſe Objections being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that Truth ſtands firm, like <hi>Mount Zion, viz.</hi> That the more holineſs you have here, the more happineſs you ſhall have hereafter; the more grace you have here on Earth, the more glory you ſhall have when you come to Heaven.</p>

The Schollar writes moſt exactly, whileſt his Maſters eye is upon him, and the Childe walks moſt exactly whileſt his Fathers eye is upon him, and the Servant works moſt exactly whileſt his Maſters eye is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: and ſo certainly all the Sons, and Servants of the moſt high God, do hear moſt exactly, and pray moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, and walk moſt exactly, when they ſet themſelves
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:104351:282"/> moſt as in the preſence of the great God, who is all ſight, who is <hi>Totus oculus,</hi> all eye. Ah friends! as ever you would bee high in holineſs, poſſeſs your hearts with a ſerious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Gods preſence, ſet your ſelves dayly as in his ſight, as under his eye; and remember, though a man may eaſily baffle his conſcience, and put out his light, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the world, like that counterfeit <hi>Alexander</hi> in <hi>Joſephus</hi> his ſtory, yet hee ſhall never be able to baffle or deceive the eye of Gods omniſciency; you ſhall as ſoon get out of the reach of his hand, as you ſhall get from under the view of his eye: God hath his windows in all our breſts, and curiouſly and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly obſerves all that is done within us, and all that is done by us; and if the ſerious conſideration of his all ſeeing eye, will not influence us to labour after the higheſt degrees of holineſs, I know not what will.

                     <p>Some there be that ſpend their time and their ſtrength in ſtudying and preaching of dry and ſapleſs controverſies, which are ſo far from bettering of mens hearts, and from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of mens lives, that they leave men as much, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times more under the power of ſin, and dominion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, than they were before; from theſe turn aſide.</p>

Mat. 23.25. &amp; ch. 6.3, 4, 5.</note> and yet readily paſs over the great and the weighty things both of the Law and of the Goſpel; they ſtand more upon circumſtantials, than upon ſubſtantials, upon a Saints-day, than upon a Sabbath-day, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an <hi>Eaſter</hi>-offering, than upon offering up of themſelves to the Lord; upon a Pipe, a Veſture, a Geſture, than upon ſaving of immortal ſouls, from theſe turn aſide.</p>
                     <p>Some there be that ſpeak two words for Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ezek. 13. 2 Pet. 2.1, 2, 3, 4 Rev. 18.11, 12, 13.</note> and ten for themſelves, that are very zealous to fleece their flocks, but are neither headed, nor hearted to feed their flocks; that minde mens goods more than their good, and the ſerving of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than the ſaving of ſouls. So they may be clad ſprucely and fate deliciouſly, and live lazily, they care not though millions of ſouls go to Hell yearly; to pick your purſes, they will indulge your conſciences; and ſo it may go well with them in this world, they care not what becomes of you in the other world; from theſe turn aſide.</p>
                     <p>And others there be that take more pains to make Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, than to make men holy; they make it their great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to win over men to their opinions,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.15.</note> when they ſhould be a winning of men over to Jeſus Chriſt; they make it more their work to convert men to their way, than they make it; their work to better mens hearts, or mend their lives, or ſave their ſouls; they will compaſs Sea and Land to make men one with themſelves, and yet think all that time and pains loſt, that is ſpent in indeavouring to make men one with Chriſt; theſe are Factors for Hell, and reſemble the Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the life, for as hee, ſo they will ſpare no pains to gain Proſelytes; from theſe turn aſide. And give up your ſelves to their labours, who make it the top of their glory to preach holineſs, to advance holineſs, to magnifie holineſs, and to practiſe holineſs; and this will be an excellent means to raiſe you up to higher degrees of holineſs. But</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Be moſt in with them that are moſt eminent and excellent in holineſs; let the delight and joy of your hearts run moſt out to them, who are ſtill adding to their ſtock of holineſs. Thus it was with that Princely Prophet in that <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
                        <pb n="578" facs="tcp:104351:284"/> 16.2, 3. <hi>My goodneſs extendeth not to thee; But to the Saints that are in the Earth, and to the Excellent, in whom is all my delight.</hi> The Diſciples by diſcourſing with Chriſt had a holy flame raiſed up in them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.32. <hi>And they ſaid one to another, did not our hearts burn within us, while hee talked with us by the way,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 18.5.</note> 
                        <hi>and opened to us the Scriptures?</hi> And when <hi>Paul</hi> met <hi>Silas</hi> and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> hee burned in ſpirit; theſe two men were eminent in holineſs, and by their company and communion, the zeal and courage of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was very much heated and raiſed. Look as one flaming Bavin may kindle a thouſand, ſo one precious Saint, in whom grace is ſtrong, and holineſs is high, may by a divine and ſecret o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, convey heat and life, power and vigour into all that touch him, or come neer unto him; even as the Load-ſtone by a ſecret operation conveyeth power and vigour into Iron. The prayers, the conferences, the counſels, and all the carriages of a man eminent in holineſs, will mightily help on the work of holineſs in their hearts, where the ſtreams of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs runs but low. Look as rich and coſtly Banquets do refreſh, and raiſe, and ſtrengthen their ſpirits, that are weak and faint. So men that are rich in grace and holineſs, will raiſe and ſtrengthen their ſpirits, who are weak in grace, and who for want of greater meaſures of holineſs, are apt to faint. Look as young plants will not thrive under dropping-trees: ſo ſuch as are weak in holineſs, will never thrive ſo long as they only aſſociate themſelves with thoſe that are weak. Look, as many times one rich man makes many poor men rich: ſo many times one man rich in holineſs makes many rich in holineſs; and therefore as over you would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in holineſs, look not ſo much at gifts, as at grace; look not ſo much at Saints out-ſides, as at their in ſides; look not ſo much at their external Garb, as at their internal worth, and alwaies make them your choiceſt, and your chiefeſt companions, who do moſt excel in grace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; their tongues, their lips, their lives, will ſtill be a drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divine marrow and farneſs, and therefore be ſure to keep moſt in with them. But</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, If ever you would attain to higher degrees of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:104351:284"/> then be much in the exerciſe and actings of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs you have; all the honour and glory that God hath from us in this world, is from the exerciſe of holineſs. Look, as the frequent actings of ſin is the ſtrengthening of ſin, ſo the frequent actings of holineſs is the ſtrengthening of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Look, as the <hi>non</hi>-exerciſe of holineſs brings upon the ſoul a decay of holineſs; ſo the exerciſe of holineſs breeds in the ſould an increaſe of holineſs. Holineſs is alwaies made more and more perfect by acting. Look as Wells are the ſweeter for drawing, and Fountains the better for over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing; ſo holineſs is ſweereſt and beſt when it is drawn into action. Look as the running-water is the beſt and ſweeteſt water; ſo the active Chriſtian is the beſt and ſweeteſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. That muſical Inſtrument alwaies makes the ſweeteſt melody, that is moſt frequently uſed, and ſo doth that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian that is moſt frequent in the exerciſe of grace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Wee get nothing by dead and uſeleſs habits, talents hid in a Napkin, gather ruſt, and the nobleſt faculties are imbaſed, when not improved in exerciſe; and therefore the Apoſtle exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> to ſtir up the gift of God that was in him, in that 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6.<note place="margin">

                     <p>O Sirs! 'tis not the having, but the husbanding of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that brings glory to God; for a man to have the habit of holineſs, and not to put it in practice, is all one as for a man to have a Talent, and to wrap it up in a Napkin. 'Twas a notable obſervation of <hi>Pliny</hi> upon <hi>Phydeus,</hi> the famous Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that had the habit of that Art above all of his time; ſaith
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:104351:285"/> hee, That great Art and skill that <hi>Phydeus</hi> had, had been to no purpoſe, had hee not exerciſed and practiſed it, upon ſome Table, ſo tis with the habits of grace and holineſs in the Saints, if they are not brought forth into exerciſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to action, 'tis all one as if they had no ſuch habits at all; Holineſs out of action, is like a candle under a Buſhel, that yeelds no comfort to a mans ſelf, nor no light to others. Though Gold bee Gold in the myne, and though it bee the moſt precious &amp; deſirable mettle in the world, yet ſo long as tis only in the myne, what profit or advantage have we by it; but now when tis dig'd out of the myne, and becomes a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in mens hands, and is fitted for uſe and ſervice, then it brings profit and advantage to men, and then the luſtre and glory of it appears: So though grace and holineſs in the habit (in the myne) bee grace and holineſs; yet what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or advantage is there in thoſe habits, till they are brought forth into action, into exerciſe, and till then all the luſtre and glory of grace and holineſs, lies hid and obſcure; the more the habits of holineſs are brought into action, the more holineſs will bee augmented and increaſed; and therefore above all, look to the frequent exerciſes &amp; actings of that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs you have: and this will bee a ready way to turn your drop of holineſs into a ſea, and your ſpark of holineſs into a flame, and your two mites of holineſs into a vaſt treaſure.

But</p>
                     <p>Eighthly and laſtly, If ever you would attain to higher degrees of holineſs, then dwell much upon the holineſs of God. O be ſtill a muſing, be ſtill a pondering upon the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of God. Certainly, if there be any means under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to raiſe you up to higher degrees of holineſs, 'tis this, and therefore keep alwaies a fixed eye upon the infinite and moſt glorious holineſs of God. Now that this direction may the better work, premiſe with mee theſe eight things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the holineſs of God.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Premiſe this with mee, that God is eſſentially holy,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.17. There is none good but God, that is, there is none eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good but God, &amp;c.</note> and in this ſenſe none is holy but himſelf. Now eſſential ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is all one with God himſelf; Gods eſſential holineſs is Gods conformity to himſelf; holineſs in God is not a quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but his eſſence, <hi>Quicquid eſt in Deo, eſt ipſe Deus,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is in God, is God; holineſs in Angels and Saints is but a quality, but in God it is his eſſence. The fallen Angels keep their natures, though they have loſt their holineſs; for that holineſs in them was a quality, and not their eſſence. Look as created holineſs is the conformity of the reaſonable creature to the Rule; ſo the increated holineſs of God, is Gods conformity unto himſelf. Gods holineſs, and his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are not two things, they are but one; Gods holineſs is his nature, and Gods nature is his holineſs. God is a pure Act, and therefore whatſoever is in God, is God; 'tis Gods prerogative royal, to be eſſentially holy; the moſt glorious creatures in Heaven, and the choiceſt ſouls on Earth, are only holy by participation, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.2. <hi>There is none holy
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:104351:288"/> as the Lord,</hi> Gods holineſs is ſo eſſential, and co-natural to him, that hee can as ſoon ceaſe to be, as ceaſe to be holy. Holineſs in God is a ſubſtance, but in Angels and men 'tis only an accident, or a quality, the eſſence of the creature may remain, when the holineſs of the creature is loſt. As you may ſee in <hi>Adam,</hi> and the fallen Angels; but Gods eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and his holineſs are alwaies the ſame; his very nature is holy,<note place="margin">Exod. 3.14.</note> and therefore 'tis that hee is called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and <hi>I Am,</hi> becauſe what hee is really, that hee is eſſentially. Though men (for our information) do diſtinguiſh between the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God, and the Nature of God, yet in him they are the ſame. Look as the Wiſdome of God, is the wiſe God, and the Truth of God, the true God, and the Power of God, the powerful God, and the Juſtice of God, the juſt God, and the Mercy of God, the merciful God, and the Mightineſs of God the mighty God, and the Righteouſneſs of God the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God, and the graciouſneſs of God the gracious God; ſo the Holineſs of God is the holy God. Gods Nature, and his Name are one and the ſame. God is eſſentially holy, and that is the top of all his glory. But</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As God is eſſentially holy, ſo God is unmixedly holy, the Holineſs of God is a pure Holineſs, 'tis an unmixed Holineſs, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.5. <hi>God is light, and in him is no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at all.</hi> There are no mixtures in God; God is a moſt clear, bright-ſhining light; yea hee is all light, and in him is no darkneſſe at all. The Moon indeed when it ſhines brighteſt,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Plato</hi> calls God the horn of plenty, and the Ocean of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without the leaſt ſpot of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, &amp;c.</note> hath her dark ſpots, and ſpecks, but God is a light that ſhines gloriouſly, without the leaſt ſpot or ſpeck. Now look as that darkneſſe which hath not the leaſt light attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, is the groſſeſt, the thickeſt <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneſſe that can be; ſo that light that hath not the leaſt cloud of darkneſſe attending it, muſt be the moſt clear, ſplendid light that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible can be, and ſuch a light is the holy one of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 'Tis very obſervable, the Apoſtle to illuſtrate the perfect purity and ſanctity of God, adds a Negative to his Affirmative; <hi>In him is no darkneſs at all,</hi> that is, God is ſo pure, that not the leaſt ſpot, the ſmalleſt ſpeck can cleave to him; hee is ſo holy, that no iniquity can be found in him; there is no defect
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:104351:288"/> not default in the Nature of God; hee is a God of Truth, and without iniquity, juſt and right is hee. As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake in that <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.4. God is a pure, a moſt pure Act, without the leaſt potentiality, defectability, or mutability; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the higheſt ſenſe hee is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all. Surely there is no unrighteouſneſſe in God, no evil can dwell with him, or come neer unto him. God ſtands at ſuch a diſtance from iniquity, yea hee ſo abhors it, that hee never did, nor never will beſtow a good look upon it, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity.</hi> There are four things that God cannot do. 1. He cannot lye. 2. Hee cannot dye. 3. Hee cannot deny himſelf; nor 4. Hee cannot look with a favourable eye upon iniquity. God doth indeed look upon iniquity with a hateful eye, with an angry eye, with a revengeful eye, and with a vindictive eye, but hee never did, nor will look upon iniquity with an eye of delectation, or with an eye of approbation, witneſſe his hurling the fallen Angels out of Heaven, and his baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſinning <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe. By all this you ſee that the Holineſſe of God is a pure Holineſſe, 'tis a Holineſſe without mixture; but now all the holineſſe that is in the beſt and choiceſt Saints in the world, is but a dreggy holineſſe, a mixt holineſſe, a weak and imperfect holineſſe; their unholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is alwaies more than their holineſſe. Ah what a deal of pride is mixt with a little humility, and what a deal of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleef is mixt with a little faith, and what a deal of paſſion is mixt with a little meekneſſe, and what a deal of earthli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is mixt with a little heavenlineſſe, and what a deal of carnalneſſe is mixt with a little ſpiritualneſſe, and what a deal of hardneſſe is mixt with a little tenderneſſe. O but now the Holineſſe of God is a pure Holineſſe, 'tis a Holineſſe without mixture, there is not the leaſt drop, nor the leaſt dregge of unholineſſe in God; 'tis true, the Gods of the Heathen were ſuch as had been impure, beaſtly, filthy men,<note place="margin">Arnobius, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin, Tertullian, &amp;c.</note> and therefore ſeveral writers have taken a great deal of pains to convince Heathens of their impiety and folly, in worſhipping ſuch for gods upon whom they faſtened many horrid, ridiculous, laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, and impious actions, and therefore they conclude
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:104351:289"/> againſt them, that they are no gods; tis moſt certain, that the true God, that Hee that is the high and the holy one cannot bee charged with any iniquity, no nor with the leaſt ſhew or ſhadow of vanity.</p>
                     <p>In God there is wiſdome without folly, truth without falſhood, light without darkneſs, &amp; holineſs without ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, As God is unmixedly holy, ſo God is Univerſally holy, hee is holy in all his waies, and holy in all his works, his precepts are holy precepts, and his promiſes are holy promiſes, and his threatnings are holy threatnings, his love is a holy love, and his anger is a holy anger, and his hatred is a holy hatred, &amp;c. His nature is holy, his attributes are holy, and all his actions are holy, hee is holy in puniſhing, and holy in ſparing, hee is holy in juſtifying of ſome, and hee is holy condemning of others, hee is holy in bringing ſome to Heaven, and holy in throwing others to Hell; God is holy in all his ſayings, and God is holy in all his doings, God is holy in what ever hee puts his hand to, and hee is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in what ever hee ſets his heart to, his frowns are holy, and his ſmiles are holy, his liftings up are holy, and his caſtings down are holy, when hee gives, his givings are holy givings, and when hee takes away, his takings are holy tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, &amp;c. But</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, As God is univerſally holy, ſo God is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently holy, hee is tranſcendently holy, hee is ſuperlatively holy,<note place="margin">Exo. 15.11.</note> and therefore hee is ſaid to bee glorious in holineſs, there is no fathoming, there is no meaſuring, there is no comprehending, there is no ſearching, of that infinite Sea of holineſs, that is in God; as neither Men nor Angels, can ſet banks or bounds to Gods holineſs, ſo neither Men nor Angels can ſound to the bottome of Gods holineſs; all that holineſs that is in Angels and Men, is but a ſpark to Gods flame; tis but a drop to his ſea; tis but a beam to his ſun; tis but a mite to his millions, &amp;c.

Now you know the Scripture ſaith, <hi>when God could ſwear by no greater, hee ſware by himſelf;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 6.13.</note> ſo I may ſay, when God could ſwear by no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Attribute, by no greater Excellency, hee ſwears by his Holineſs; that being the top and the glory of all. Look as all the wiſdome of the creatures compar'd with the wiſdome of God, is but folly; and as all the goodneſs of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures compared with the goodneſs of God is but naughtineſs; and as all the fulneſſe of the creature compared with the fulneſſe of God is but emptineſs; and as all the power of the creature, compared with the power of God is but weakneſſe; and as all the righteouſneſſe of the creature, compared with the righteouſneſſe of God, is but unrighteouſneſſe: So all the holineſſe of the creature, compared with the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, is but unholineſſe; mans higheſt purity, is but impurity, when 'tis compared to the purity of God, yea, the very holineſſe of Angels, compared with the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, is chargeable with folly; <hi>Job.</hi> 4.18. That fulneſſe of holineſſe that is in Angels or Saints, is only the fulneſſe of the Veſſel, but that fulneſſe of holineſſe that is in God, is the fulneſſe of the Fountain; that fulneſſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe that is in Angels or Saints, is but the fulneſſe of the Branches, but that fulneſſe of holineſſe that is in God, is the fulneſſe of the Root; that fulneſſe of holineſſe that is in Angels or Saints, is but the fulneſſe of Sufficiency, but that
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:104351:290"/> fulneſſe of holineſſe that is in God, is the fulneſſe of redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy. But,</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, As God is infinitely holy, tranſcendently holy, ſuperlatively holy; ſo God is originally, radically, and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally holy; the Divine Nature is the root, original, and ſpring of all holineſſe and purity; all that holineſſe that is in Angels and men flows from God, as the ſtreams from the Fountain, as the beams from the Sun, as the branches from the Root, and as the effect from the Cauſe. There is no holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be had, but from the Holy One, hee is the Author and Original of all the holineſſe that ever was, or that is this day in the world, all the ſeeds of holineſs, and all the roots of holineſs that are to be found in Angels or men,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.11.</note> are of the Lords ſowing and planting. All that holineſs that the Angels had in Heaven, and all that holineſs that <hi>Adam</hi> had in Paradiſe, and all that holineſs that Chriſt had in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, and all that holineſs that ever any Saints have had was from God, and all that holineſs that any Saints now have is from God. The Divine Nature is the firſt root and original fountain of all ſanctity and purity, <hi>James</hi> 1.17. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters may pray that their people may be holy, and Parents may pray that their children may be holy, and Maſters may pray that their ſervants may be holy, and husbands may pray that their wives may be holy, and Wives may pray that their husbands may be holy; but none of theſe can give holineſſe, none of theſe can communicate holineſſe to their neareſt and deareſt relations; tis only God that is the giver and the Author of all holineſſe. If holy perſons could convey ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe into others ſouls, they would never ſuffer them to go to Hell for want of holineſs; to hand out holineſs to others, is a work too high for Angels, and too hard for all mortals; 'tis only the Holy One that can cauſe holineſs to flow into ſinners hearts; 'tis only hee that can form, and frame, and infuſe holineſs into the ſouls of men.</p>
                     <p>A man ſhall ſooner make a man, yea make a world, and unmake himſelf, than hee ſhall make another holy; tis only a holy God that can enlighten the mind, and bow the will and melt the heart, and raiſe the affections, and purge the
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:104351:291"/> conſcience, and reform the life, and put the whole man into a holy gracious frame and temper. But</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, As God is originally, radically, and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally holy;<note place="margin">Iſa. 44.24. Rev. 1.18.</note> ſo God is independently holy; the Holineſs of God depends upon nothing below God. God is the <hi>Alpha,</hi> the fountain from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ence all holineſſe ſprings, and hee is the <hi>Omega,</hi> the Sea to which all glory runs. As all our holineſs is from God, ſo all our holineſs muſt terminate in the honour and glory of God. 'Tis God alone that is independently ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. All that holineſs that is in Angels and men, is a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent holineſs, it depends upon the Holineſs of God, as the ſtreams depend upon the Fountain, the beams upon the Sun, the branches upon the Root, and the members upon the Head. God is <hi>(Unum principium ex quo cuncta dependent)</hi> one beginning, upon whom all things depend. God hath his Being only of himſelf, and 'tis hee alone that gives Being unto all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things. God is the firſt cauſe, and without all cauſes himſelf; the very Beings that Angels and men have, they have by participation from God. And 'tis the firſt cauſe that giveth unto all cauſes their proper operations, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.6. <hi>I am the firſt, and I am the laſt, and beſides mee there is no God.</hi> God never had a cauſe of his Being, as all other creatures have; He is a glorious being, a holy being, without all cauſes, either efficient, or formal, or material, or final; and therefore hee muſt needs be independently holy. Look as the power of God is an independent power, and the wiſdome of God an independent wiſdome, and the goodneſs of God an independent goodneſs, and the righteouſneſs of God an independent righteouſneſs; ſo the holineſs of God is an independent holineſs. And as it is the glory of his power, that his power is an independent power, and the glory of his goodneſſe, that his goodneſſe is an independent goodneſſe; ſo 'tis the glory of his holineſſe, that his holineſſe is an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent holineſſe. And look as all that power that Angels and men have depends upon the power of God, and as all that wiſdome that Angels and men have, depends upon the wiſdome of God, and as all that goodneſſe that Angels and men have depends upon the goodneſſe of God; ſo all that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:104351:291"/> that Angels and men have, depends upon the holineſſe of God, &amp;c. <hi>Philo</hi> could ſay, that God is ſuch a fountain, that hee breaks forth with the ſtreams of his goodneſſe upon all things, but receives nothing back again from any to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelf therewith. There are none in Heaven, nor none on Earth that are abſolutely independent but God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, As God is independently holy; ſo God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly holy, hee is unchangeably holy, hee was holy yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and hee is holy to day, and hee will be holy for ever; What is natural is conſtant, and laſting: Now Gods holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is natural, to him; 'tis as natural for God to be holy, as 'tis for us to breathe, yea as 'tis for us to bee unholy. God can as well and as ſoon ceaſe to bee, as hee can ceaſe to be holy; Holineſſe is his nature, as well as his name; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his holineſſe cannot decay; though ours may, whatever wee may loſe of our holineſſe, yet 'tis certain that God can never loſe one grain of that holineſſe that is in him. Here our holineſſe ebbs and flows, but the Holineſſe of God never ebbs, but is alwaies a flowing, and over-flowing, there is ſtill a full tyde of Holineſſe in God. Though the Saints can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall from that ſeed of holineſſe that is ſown in their hearts,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.9.</note> yet they may fall from ſome degrees of holineſſe, that they have formerly attained to, they that have been old men in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, may fall from being old men, to be but young men in holineſſe, and they that have been young men in holineſſe,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.12, 13, 14. 2 Pet. 2.1, 2, 3.</note> may fall from being young men to be but children in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and they that have been children in holineſs, may fall from being children, to be but babes in holineſs; but now that holineſs that is in God, is never ſubject to any decayings, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batings, or languiſhing; that ſpring, that Sea of holineſs that is in God, is no waies capable of diminution, nor of Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plato</hi> could ſay that God is one and the ſame,<note place="margin">Pierius.</note> and alwaies like himſelf. And it was a cuſtome among the <hi>Turks</hi> to cry out every morning from a high Tower, God alwaies was, and alwaies will bee, and ſo ſalute their Mahomet; O Sirs! God hath been alwaies holy, and God will bee alwaies holy;
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:104351:292"/> whatever men may loſe, yet God is reſolved that hee will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loſe his honour, nor his holineſs. But</p>
                     <p>Eighthly and laſtly, As God is continually holy, ſo God is exemplarily holy.<note place="margin">Levit. 20.26. Remember this, you and I muſt anſwer for examples, as well as precepts</note> Hee is the Rule, Pattern, and Example of holineſs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Bee yee holy, as I am holy.</hi> Gods Holineſs is the great example and pattern of all that holineſs which is in the creatures. Gods holineſs is the Copy that we muſt alwaies have in our eye, and indeavour moſt exactly to write after. Carnal friends, and this blinde world, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, and ſuch as love to Lord it over the conſcience, will be ſtill a preſenting to you other examples and patterns, but 'tis your wiſdome, and your work, to caſt them all behinde your backs, and to trample them under your feet, and to follow that form and pattern that the Lord hath ſet before you. And that is, to bee holy as hee is holy. All our holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to be brought to the Holineſs of God, as the ſtandard and meaſure of it; and therefore, oh what cauſe have wee to be ſtill a perfecting holineſs in the fear of the Lord. And thus I have done with the ſecond thing, <hi>viz.</hi> Means to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe holineſs, and to raiſe you up to the higheſt pitches and degrees of holineſs.</p>
                     <p>And ſo I come to the third thing propoſed, and that was, to lay down ſome ſigns or evidences whereby perſons may know whether they have attained to any high pitch, or emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent degrees of holineſs or no. Now Sirs, if you deſire in good earneſt to know whether you have attained to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of holineſs, or no, then ſeriouſly weigh theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars, and try your ſelves by them.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The more a man can warm his heart at the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and cleave to the Promiſes, and reſt upon the Promiſes, and ſuck marrow, and fatneſs, and ſweetneſs out of the breaſts of the Promiſes; when Divine Providences (ſeem to) run croſs to Divine Promiſes. The greater meaſure of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that man hath attained to, where there are but little mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of holineſs, there every ſeeming contrariety to the Promiſe troubles a man, and every little cloud that hangs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Promiſe, will mightily perplex a man, &amp;c. But where holineſs is raiſed to any conſiderable height, there that man

It is an Argument that Holineſs is grown up to ſome conſiderable height there. A little Grace, a little Holineſs, will work a man to conflict with groſſe ſins, with outward ſins, with bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſins, with ſuch ſins that every one may ſet their eyes on, and lay their hands on; yea where there is no Grace, no Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe at all, the light of Nature, the common convictions of the Spirit, the Laws of Men, the eyes of Men, the threats of Men, the examples of Men, a ſmarting Rod, and good Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, may work men to conflict with ſuch ſins; O but when all the ſtrength and might of the ſoul is ingaged againſt thoſe very ſins that lye not within the ſight or reach of the moſt ſharp and piercing men in the world, but in the heart, and about the heart, and are only obvious to an Omniſcient eye, this argues a great degree of Holineſſe; And therefore <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>

O!

Now look as conflicts with heart-ſins, with ſpiritual-ſins, &amp;c. argues ſome eminency in Holineſſe: ſo victory over heart-ſins, over-ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſins, over thoſe ſins that lye moſt remote from the eyes of others, argues a very great degree of Holineſſe; when a Chriſtian doth not onely reſiſt heart-ſins, but vanquiſhes heart-ſins, when hee doth not only combate with heart-ſins, but conquers heart-ſins; when hee doth not only fight with heart-ſins, but alſo overcomes heart-ſins, when hee doth not only wreſtle with heart-ſins, but alſo overthrows heart-ſins; this ſpeaks out holineſs in its growth. 'Twas a good ſaying of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> there is no ſuch pleaſure (ſaith hee) as to have overcome an offered pleaſure, neither is there any greater conqueſt, than that that is gotten over a mans corruptions.

But,</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, The more ſolid, preciſe, exact, and accurate a Chriſtian is in religious duties and ſervices, the greater meaſure of holineſſe that Chriſtian hath attained to, and the more any Chriſtian grows in holineſſe, the more ſpiritual, the more ſavory, the more exact, and accurate hee will grow in all his religious ſervices and performances: The more a Chriſtians heart is endeared to religious duties, &amp; the more his heart is affected with the heavenly nature of religious duties, and the more eaſily, the more holily, the more freely, &amp; the more ſpiritually, he performs religious duties, the more he is thriven &amp; grown in holineſs. A young Carpenter gives more blows, &amp; makes more noiſe &amp; chips, than an old experienced workman doth, but the old experienced workman doth his work more ſolidly, more exactly, and more accurately, than the young Carpenter doth; So many young Chriſtians that are but newly entred into the trade of Chriſtianity, and that are raiſed up, but to a very ſmall degree of ſanctity, theſe may multiply duties upon duties, theſe may abound in religious performances, theſe may bee much in adding of ſervice to ſervice; but yet the aged and experienced Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in grace and holineſſe, doth duties more ſolidly, more ſpiritually, more exactly, and more accurately, than the young Chriſtian doth: Wee muſt never judge of an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency in holineſſe, by the number or multitude of our duties, but by the ſeriouſneſſe, the graciouſneſſe, the ſolidneſſe, the ſpiritualneſſe, the holineſſe, the heavenlineſſe, and the accurateneſſe of our hearts in duties. A young Muſitian may play longer, and more quick and nimble upon an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, than an old Muſitian can, but yet the old Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian playes with more art, accurateneſſe, skill, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

A young Scholar may run over more paper, and write more paper, and make more letters, than his Maſter doth, but yet his Maſter writes more underſtandingly, exactly, and accurately, than hee doth.</p>
                     <p>So many young converts may run over more duties than others, and yet others may perform duties more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly, and more exactly, and more accurately than they do; let the duty bee never ſo ſhort, yet if there bee much ſpiritualneſſe, holineſſe, brokenneſſe, ſeriouſneſſe, and accurateneſſe in it, it will carry all before it, 'twill win the bleſſing, and obtain the crown, when the longeſt duties (wherein there is no ſuch frame nor temper of ſpirit) ſhall not prevail with God at all. <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.4, 5, 6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.1.—6.

A man may have his Name ſet down in the Chronicles, yet loſt; wrought in durable Marble, yet periſh, ſet upon a Monument equal to a Coloſſus, yet be ignominius, inſcribed on the Hoſpital gates, yet go to Hell, written in the front of his own houſe, yet another come to poſſeſs it. All theſe are but writings in the duſt, or upon the waters, where the Characters periſh ſo ſoon as they are made, they no more prove a man happy, than the fool could prove <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> happy, becauſe his Name was written in the Creed, but in real Sanctification a man may ſee his Name ſo written in the Book of Gods Election, as that it ſhall

                     <p>Secondly, If thou are a holy perſon, if thou haſt that real holineſs, without which there is no happineſs, then know for thy comfort, that the Lord takes ſingular pleaſure, delight and complacency, both in thy holineſs, and in thy perſon, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 149.4, 5. <hi>For the Lord taketh pleaſure in his people; hee will beautifie the meek with ſalvation. Let the Saints be joyful in glory; let them ſing aloud upon their beds.</hi> The Hebrew word <hi>Rotſeh,</hi> that is here rendred pleaſure, is from <hi>Ratſah,</hi> that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies pleaſure, delight, complacency, content, &amp;c. O, God takes ſingular pleaſure, ſingular delight, ſingular complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ſingular content in all his Saints, in all his ſanctified ones. Holineſs is the expreſs Image of God, and therefore hee cannot but take pleaſure in it, and in all thoſe that bear it, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.13. <hi>The Remnant of Iſrael ſhall not do iniquity, nor ſpeak lies: neither ſhall a deceitful tongue bee found in their mouth.</hi> Well, here are glorious Characters of their holineſs, but what pleaſure, what delight, &amp;c. doth God take in theſe holy ones? why certainly very much, as you may ſee in <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>The Lord thy God in the midſt of thee is mighty: hee will ſave, hee will rejoyce over thee with joy; hee will rest in his love, hee will joy over thee with ſinging.</hi> Look as a Bridegroom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces over his Bride;<note place="margin">Iſa. 62.4, 5.</note> ſo will the Lord rejoyce over his holy ones; and look what delight, complacency and content the Bridegroom takes in his Bride, the ſame, yea greater God takes in all his ſanctified ones. Yea look as a fond Father joyes over his dear childe that hee carries in his arms, or dandles upon his knee, with ſinging: ſo God will joy over all his holy ones (which are his fondlings) with ſinging; ſuch is the ſingular delight, ſatisfaction and content that hee takes in them. Look as the Husbandman delights much in that ground that was once barren, but is now fruitful; and as the Captain takes a great deal of pleaſure in that ſouldier that once run from his colours, but is now returned, and fights valiantly and reſolutely againſt all oppoſers and adverſaries; and as the Father takes a great deal of joy, content, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in the return, reformation, and amendment of his Prodigal Son;<note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> even ſo a holy God is wonderfully delighted,

Ephe. 5.25, 26, 27. 1 John. 3.9.</note> now holineſs is himſelf; and therefore if there bee but a ſpark of holineſs in a dunghill of corruption, Chriſt will certainly own it, cheriſh it, and preſerve it; hee that is once really holy, ſhall bee for ever holy. Let the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, do what they can, the holy ſeed ſhall ſtill remain in all Gods ſanctified ones; though a holy man may fall ſtrangely, ſadly, frequently, foully, yet hee ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall totally, hee ſhall never fall finally, becauſe that that holineſs that is in him, is a laſting, yea, an ever-laſting and abiding principle, that can never bee deſtroyed, or extirpated. A wicked perſon may bee turned into a holy man, but a holy man can never bee turned into a prophane perſon again. A holy change is an unchangeable change, the ſtate of holineſs is an unchangeable ſtate: 'Tis true the fallen Angels quickly loſt that ſtock of holineſs, that God had put into their hands; and <hi>Adam</hi> loſt all his holineſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the turn of a hand, hee broke, and proved a Bankrupt almoſt as ſoon as God had ſet him up in Paradiſe, but the ſtate and condition of all the Saints, is a better and a ſafer ſtate and condition, than either the Angels, or than <hi>Adams</hi> was; and that partly becauſe their ſtate was mutable though perfect, but the ſtate of the Saints is an unchangeable ſtate, though it bee (for the preſent) an imperfect ſtate; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe God put that ſtock of holineſs, that they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own hands, but now the Saints holineſs is not a ſtock in their own hands, but in Chriſts hands; for not only their perſons, but their holineſs is kept by the power of God,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.5.</note> through faith unto ſalvation. As Chriſt is to manage our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for us, ſo hee is to manage our grace and holineſs for us; and therefore as hee will moſt certainly make ſure the one, ſo hee will as certainly preſerve the other; once a Son,<note place="margin">John. 8.35.</note> and for ever a Son; though the ſervant may bee turned out of doors, yet the Son abides in the houſe for ever, as Chriſt ſpeaks, hee that is once ſanctified, ſhall bee for ever bleſſed.</p>
                     <p>Holineſs is an abiding ſeed, an immortal ſeed; 'tis a royal gift, which being once given, ſhall never be taken away from him that hath it. I readily grant, that the ſtrength of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

There is alwaies a divine fire, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it may be raked up under the Aſhes; there is alwaies life and ſap in the root, though there be neither leaves nor bloſſomes on the tree; 'tis true, the beſt of Saints may have their ſpiritual Autumn; and 'tis as true, that after their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, there will certainly follow a Spring of Holineſs. 'Tis moſt certain, that the truth and ſtate of Holineſs remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all a Chriſtians infirmities, darkneſſes, weakneſſes, ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſes, clouds, failings, waverings and wandrings; and the reaſons are clear, becauſe that great and glorious principle of Holineſs flows from Gods unchangeable love, and is a fruit of the everlaſting Covenant, and the price of Chriſts Blood, and depends and hangs upon a perpetual union and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt,<note place="margin">Deut. 33.26, 27.

That the Surety of the New Covenant is grown very poor and weak, which is very little leſs than blaſphemy, and quite contrary to that <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.21, 22. 2.

The blinde mans Promiſe, and I may call it the lame mans Promiſe, that is holy, and the deaf mans Promiſe, that is holy, and the dumb mans Promiſe, that is holy, and the needy mans Promiſe, that is holy, and the ſick mans Promiſe, that is holy, and the languiſhing mans Promiſe, that is holy, and the dying mans Promiſe, that is holy. O the comfort! O the ſweet! O the content! O the ſatisfaction that this Promiſe hath afforded to many a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Saint, when other Promiſes have not been at hand! O Chriſtian! what though friends and relations frown upon thee, what though enemies are plotting and conſpiring againſt thee, what though wants like an armed man are ready to break in upon thee; what though men rage, and Devils roar; what though ſickneſs be in thy family, and death ſtands every day at thy elbow, yet there is no reaſon for thee to fear or faint, becauſe all theſe things ſhall work for thy good. Yea there is wonderful cauſe of joy and rejoycing in all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and tribulations that comes upon thee, conſidering that they ſhall all work for thy good. O Chriſtians! I am afraid, I am afraid, that you do not run ſo often as you ſhould to the breaſts of this Promiſe, nor draw that ſweetneſs and comfort from it that it would yeeld, and that your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral caſes may require; and thus I have done with this uſe of comfort and conſolation to all Gods holy ones. You ſee what comfort, what conſolation, yea what ſtrong conſolation waits upon all Gods ſanctified ones.

                     <p>And now I have nothing to do, but to lay down ſome Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions concerning Holineſs, which may be of ſingular uſe, for the preventing of ſome Objections and miſtakes, and for the giving of ſatisfaction, eſpecially to ſuch in whom the ſtreams of Holineſs runs low, and who are ſtill a lamenting and mourning under the imperfections of their Holineſs, &amp;c.</p>
                     <pb n="639" facs="tcp:104351:314"/>
                     <p>And the firſt Poſition is this, Where ever real Holineſs is, it will appear, it will diſcover it ſelf, it will ſhew it ſelf;<note place="margin">Eph. 4.15, 16.</note> it is the very nature of Grace and Holineſs, to manifeſt it ſelf; and therefore it is ſet forth in Scripture by the names of light, which ſhines abroad, and of ointment and perfume,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.16. Prov. 27.9. Cant. 3.6.</note> which cannot be hid; of Leaven and Salt, which deriveth its own nature and relliſh upon a whole lump: And 'tis very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that when the Holy Ghoſt was given,<note place="margin">Act. 2.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> he was given in tongues, fiery tongues, and with a ruſhing of a mighty wind, all which have a quality of ſelf-manifeſtation, and notifying of themſelves to others.</p>
                     <p>Take a River that is damm'd and ſtopt up, yet if the courſe of it be natural, and if it commonly runs downward, it will at length bear down all, and ride and run triumphantly over all that is in its way: So though real Holineſs in a day of temptation, deſertion, and affliction, &amp;c. may ſeem to bee damm'd and ſtopt up, yet at length it will make its way through all, &amp; over all, and ſhew its ſelf in its native colours. Though fire for a time may lye hid under the Aſhes, yet at laſt it will flame forth, and ſhew it ſelf to be fire; Holineſs is a divine fire, and though in ſome caſes it may for a time ſeem to bee hid, it will at length break forth and ſhew it ſelf to be Holineſſe. I have not Faith enough to beleeve that that man was ever really holy, whoſe Holineſſe is ſtill un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>er a buſhel, or in a dark Lanthorn. Look as natural life can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo hid, but that it will diſcover it ſelf a hundred hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred waies: So Holineſſe, which is a Chriſtians ſpiritual life, cannot be ſo hid, but it will diſcover it a hundred, hundred waies.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Poſition is this, That Holineſs riſes by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, it riſes gradually in the ſouls of the Saints. Though the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was made a man a holy man,<note place="margin">Job. 17.9. Pſal. 92.12. Mal. 4.2. Hoſ. 14.5, 6, 7.</note> yea man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly holy, and all at once; yet the Holineſs of all that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> riſes by degrees. 'Tis true in the Creation of the world, all the creatures were made in their full and perfect growth and ſtrength at once; but in the new Creation, Holineſs, which is Gods own creature, is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by degrees.<note place="margin">Luk. 2.52.</note> Look as Chriſt increaſed in wiſdome
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:104351:315"/> and in ſtature, and in favour with God and man, by degrees. So that Babe of Grace, Holineſs, increaſes in the ſoul by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Look as the ſeed which is ſown in the furrows of the earth,<note place="margin">Mat. 13.23. Mark 4.28.</note> firſt ſprings into a blade, and then into an ear, and then into ripe Corn: So that immortal ſeed, Holineſs, which is ſown in the furrows of a Chriſtians ſoul, ſprings and grows by degrees. Look as the waters in the Sanctuary riſe firſt to the ancles, then to the knees, then to the loins, then to the chin,<note place="margin">Ezek. 47.3, 4, 5.</note> and then to a River that was not paſſable: So Holineſſe riſes higher and higher in the ſoul by degrees. Look as the morning light ſhines more and more unto the perfect day:<note place="margin">Prov. 4.18.</note> So the light of Holineſſe ſhines more and more clear, and more and more bright, until all darkneſſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection be ſwallowed up in perfection. Look as the body of a man grows and increaſes by degrees in ſtature and ſtrength till it comes to its full growth and perfection:<note place="margin">Eph. 4.16.</note> So Grace and Holineſſe will grow and increaſe by degrees, till Grace bee turned into Glory, till Holineſs bee turned into Happineſs. Though the Ocean be full, yet the bottle cannot bee filled but by degrees. Wee are poor narrow-mouthed Bottles, and therefore what wee take in of Holineſſe; muſt bee by degrees; our incapacity is ſo great, that at preſent wee are no waies able to take in a fulneſſe of Holineſſe; and therefore God drops in now a drop, and then a drop; now a little, and then a little, as wee are able to take it in. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to difference the ſtate of Grace from the ſtate of Glory, the ſtate of Holineſs from the ſtate of Happineſſe; 'tis neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that Holineſſe ſhould be communicated to us by degrees, an abſolute fulneſs of holineſs will make an abſolute fulneſs of happineſs; when our holineſs is perfect, our happineſs ſhall be perfect; and if this were attainable on earth, there would be but little reaſon for men to long to bee in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>The third Poſition is this, that there is a great deal of preciouſneſſe in the leaſt degree of holineſſe. For</p>
                     <p n="1">1. 'Tis the ſpecial work of the holy Spirit; and this I have ſhewed you already at large; and therefore it muſt needs be precious.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. 'Tis a part of the Divine Nature, 'tis a beam of God,
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:104351:315"/> a ſpark of Glory; and therefore it muſt needs be precious.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4. Mat. 12.20. Iſa. 40 10, 11. ch. 60.22. Iſa. 35.3, 4. Joel 3.10. Mat. 5.3, 4, 5, 6. Rom. 14.1. ch. 15.7.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. There are many choice and ſpecial Promiſes that are made over to the leaſt degrees of Holineſſe, as you may ſee by comparing the Scriptures in the Margint together; and therefore the leaſt degree of holineſſe is very precious.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It gives a man a right to precious Priviledges, and to all the precious Ordinances of Chriſts houſe. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. 'Tis a fruit of the ſpecial love and favour of God; a man may read more of the heart of God, and of the ſpecial love of God towards him in the leaſt ſpark of holineſſe, than hee can in his higheſt worldly enjoyments. A man may read that ſpecial grace in the leaſt degree of holineſſe, which hee can never read in the honours, profits, pleaſures, delights, and contents of this world. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. The leaſt degrees of holineſſe gives a man as great a right,<note place="margin">The little hand of a childe may hold a Pearl as well as the hand of the greateſt Giant in the world.</note> and as good a title to everlaſting happineſſe and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe, as the greateſt degrees of holineſſe doth, and the reaſon is clear, becauſe the promiſe of happineſſe and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe is not made over to degrees of holineſſe, but to the truth of holineſſe; and therefore hee that hath but the leaſt ſpark of true holineſſe, may plead the Promiſe, and apply the Promiſe, and ſuck marrow and ſweetneſſe out of the Promiſe, as well as hee that hath the greateſt meaſures of holineſſe in the world. The Promiſes of Salvation are not made over to the ſtrength of Faith, but to the truth of Faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.35. 'Tis no where ſaid, that only hee that beleeves with the Faith of an <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſhall bee ſaved; but 'tis often ſaid, <hi>Hee that beleeves ſhall bee ſaved;</hi> that is, hee that beleeves truly, though hee doth not beleeve ſtrongly, ſhall bee ſaved. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. When unholy perſons are under terrours of conſcience,<note place="margin">A little holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is like a Diamond very little in bulk but of a very high price and value, &amp;c.</note> and upon their dying-beds, and when they ſhall ſtand before a judgement ſeat, had they as many worlds to give, as there bee ſtars in Heaven, and as there are men on Eart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="642" facs="tcp:104351:316"/>8. The leaſt degree of holineſſe ſhall at laſt bee bleſt with a happy triumph over the ſtrongeſt corruptions, the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of holineſſe will lead the ſoul to Chriſt, it will bring the ſoul into communion with Chriſt, it will work the ſoul to lean upon Chriſt, and by degrees to draw that life, that vertue, and that vigour from Chriſt, that will inable a Chriſtian not only to combate, but to conquer even <hi>Goliah</hi> himſelf; and therefore the leaſt degree of holineſſe is doubtleſſe very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>

But</p>
                     <p>Tenthly and laſtly, The leaſt degree of holineſſe is a ſure pledge and pawn, of greater degrees of holineſſe, that in time thou ſhalt attain to.

                     <p>The fourth Poſition is this, All Saints are not alike holy; ſome are more holy, and others are leſſe holy; in ſome Saints the ſprings of Holineſs runs low, in others the ſprings of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs riſe very high. Holineſs thrives not alike in all Saints;<note place="margin">Mat. 13.8.23. Mat. 25.14, 15.

All Saints are not of equal ſtanding in the houſe of God. All Saints have not been partakers of equal means, all Saints have not had equal gales of the Spirit, all Saints have not alike acted that holineſs they have; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no wonder if all Saints are not alike holy. <hi>Davids</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies were not all of equal ſtrength, nor all the ſtones in the building are not of equal proportion, nor all the members in the natural body are not of equal magnitude; and ſo 'tis alſo in the myſtical body of Chriſt.

Chriſt hath not work alike for all Saints to do, nor burdens alike for all Saints to bear, nor mercies alike for all Saints to improve, nor temptations alike for all Saints to reſiſt, nor difficulties alike for all Saints to grapple withall, nor dangers alike for all Saints to encounter withall, &amp;c. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee gives not a like meaſure of holineſs to all, but to ſome more, to others leſs, according as their condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, Some Saints ſtand in need of a great deal more grace and holineſs than others do. Their place, calling, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and imployments in the world calls for a greater ſtock, than others need. One man may better keep houſe with a hundred a year, than another who hath a great family, and great reſort to his houſe, can do with a thouſand a year; and ſo 'tis here. A little may ſerve a little Farm; but it muſt be a great ſtock that muſt ſerve a great Farm. A little ſtock of Holineſſe will ſerve ſome Chriſtians, but it muſt be a great ſtock of Holineſs that muſt ſerve to ſupply the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, and the wants of other Chriſtians; and therefore God gives different meaſures and degrees of holineſs among his people as their needs require. Look as one ſinner excels another in wickedneſs, ſo one Saint excels another in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and therefore let not thoſe that have much holineſs deſpiſe thoſe that have but little; nor let not thoſe that have but a little holineſs cenſure or judge thoſe that have more holineſs than themſelves.<note place="margin">Read the 77. and the 88. Pſalms. And indeed moſt of the Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> are a full proof of this Poſition, as all may ſee that will but read them with a ſpiritual eye, and with, and underſtanding heart.</note> All that holineſs that any man hath, whether it bee little, or whether it bee much, is all of Grace, it is all of free-grace; and therefore let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man improve it, bee thankful for it, and walk humbly under it.</p>
                     <p>The fift Poſition is this; A Chriſtian may bee more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently Holy at one time, than at another, hee may thrive and increaſe more in holineſs at one ſeaſon, than at another; two men do not more differ one from another, than [the ſelf ſame Chriſtian at ſeveral times differs from himſelf. Now the Spring-tide of Holineſs is riſen high, very high at another time the ſtreams of Holineſs runs exceeding low; now hee
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:104351:317"/> is full fraughted with high thoughts of God, with honourable thoughts of Chriſt, with precious thoughts of the Saints, with pious thoughts of the Scripture, with delightful thoughts of Ordinances, with ſerious thoughts of Providences, and with raviſhing thoughts of Eternity;<note place="margin">Beſides the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Jacob, Joſeph, Job,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> with the experiences of all other Saints in all ages, ſpeaks out this truth.</note> and at another time you ſhall have him filled with ſuch hard thoughts of God, with ſuch diſhonourable thoughts of Chriſt, with ſuch low thoughts of the Saints, with ſuch ſlight thoughts of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with ſuch undelightful thoughts of Ordinances, and with ſuch confuſed thoughts of Providences, and with ſuch muddy dark and unpleaſing thoughts of Eternity, as if hee were really another man; now hee is very lively and quick, very cheerful and thankful, very fruitful and faithful; now hee is very fearful of offending God, and very careful of pleaſing God, and very circumſpect and watchful in his walking with God, as if hee were a man fully reſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to ſtart from holineſs to happineſs; but now if you pleaſe to look on this man at another time, when hee is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſerted of God, or tempted by Satan, or worſted by the World, or enthraled by his Luſts; and Ah! how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like himſelf will you then finde him, for now hee is flat and dull, and dry (though not quite dead) now hee is much ſtreightned and ſhut up, now hee can neither joy in God, nor delight in Chriſt, nor finde ſweetneſs in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nances, nor any taſte or reliſh in any of his mercies. Now his Apprehenſions are dark, his Thoughts are diſmal, his Meditations are confuſed, his Words are unadviſed, and his waies are crooked; now hee ſaith <hi>the Lord is my Portion,</hi> and anon hee ſaith, <hi>will the Lord caſt off for ever, and will he bee favourable no more?</hi> now hee beleeves, anon hee doubts, this hour hee hopes, the next hee fears, to day hee is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mount, joying and triumphing, to morrow you ſhall have him in the vallies, mourning and ſighing; many clouds, many eclipſes, many varieties, and many changes, paſſes upon Gods holy ones in this life. A Childe, a Tree, a Plant, ſhoots up ſometimes more in a month, than they do in many months; and ſo doth many a Childe of God, many a Tree of righteouſneſs, and many a Plant of renown,
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:104351:318"/> ſhoots up more in holineſs in a month ſometimes, than they do in many months at another time; they thrive and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in holineſs more in a year ſometimes, than they do in many years, at another time. Look as many a man gets more mony in one year, than hee doth afterwards get in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ſo many a Chriſtian gets more grace and holineſs, ſometimes in one year, than hee gets afterwards in ſeven. No Saints have at all times a like the ſame bleſſed gales of the Spirit; 'tis juſt with a holy ſoul, as 'tis with a ſhip, ſometimes the ſhip hath a very fair and freſh gale of wind, and then ſhee cuts her way through the proud waves of the Sea, and the Paſſengers ſail very ſpeedily and merrily to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their deſired Port; but anon the wind is ſlack, and veres about to another point of the Compaſs, and then the Paſſengers are all amote, and they ſail but ſlowly and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily towards their deſired Harbour? And ſo 'tis with a holy heart, ſometimes the gales of the ſpirit blow very fair and ſweet, very ſtrong and powerful, upon a gracious ſoul; and then a Chriſtian ſails moſt ſweetly, moſt ſpeedily, and moſt ſucceſsfully on in a way of Holineſs, and towards his Port of Happineſs; but anon the ſpirit is either reſiſted or griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or neglected, or quenched, or vexed, or diſobeyed; and then his gales, his influences, his breathings are ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then a poor Chriſtian ſails but very ſlow on in a way of holineſs, then hee doth but even creep towards the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of everlaſting bleſſedneſs.</p>
                     <p>Again no Saints have at all times alike the ſame external, helps, advantages, and opportunities of being holy, and of thriving in holineſs: It may bee they have not the word ſo clearly, ſo powerfully, ſo ſweetly ſo faithfully, nor ſo frequently, preacht to them, as formerly they have had; or it may bee they have not other Ordinances ſo lively, ſo purely, ſo ſpiritually, ſo evangelically diſpenced to them, as formerly they have had; It may bee they have had ſtones inſtead of bread, and bones inſtead of fleſh, and chaffe inſtead of wheat, and muddy water inſtead of choice wine, and then no wonder if they do not thrive in holineſs, as they did when God rained Mannah every day
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:104351:318"/> about their Tents, and when they were fed with the beſt of the beſt, that their Heavenly Fathers Table, Wine-ſeller, and Houſe did afford. When Children have not as good Food, and as good Phyſick, and as good lodging, and as good looking to, as they have formerly had, no wonder if they thrive not, as at other times. And ſo 'tis here; look as no men have alwaies the ſame helps, the ſame advantages, the ſame opportunities, to grow great, and rich, and high, and honourable in the world, that ſometimes they have had; ſo no Chriſtian hath alwaies the ſame helps, advantages, and opportunities to grow rich, and high in holineſs, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hee hath had: It may bee hee hath not that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and fellowſhip with the people of God, that once hee had, or if hee hath, yet it may bee their communion is not ſo pure, ſo holy, ſo lively, ſo heart-warming, ſo ſoul-inriching, as once it hath been, or it may bee hee hath not as good counſel as formerly, nor as good examples as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, nor as good encouragement, as hee hath formerly had to bee holy; or it may bee their calling, imployment, and outward condition is ſo altered and changed from what once it was; that they have not that time for clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet Duties, and to wait on publick Ordinances, that once they had; or it may bee bodily infirmities, weakneſſes, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, aches, and ailements are ſo increaſed and multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them, that they cannot make that improvement that once they did, of thoſe very advantages, and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, that yet by a hand of grace is continued among them; now theſe caſes being incident to the people of God, there is no reaſon to wonder, if at ſome times, Saints are more holy than they are at others; and if at ſome ſeaſons they ſhoot up more in holineſs, than they do at others: The ſerious weighing of this Poſition, may ſerve to prevent many fears and ſcruples, many debates and diſputes, that often riſe in the hearts of Chriſtians, upon the often ebbings and flowings of holineſs in their ſouls.</p>
                     <p>The ſixt Poſition is this; There will come a time when in this world, holineſs ſhall bee more general, and more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, than ever it hath been ſince <hi>Adam</hi> fell in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe;
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:104351:319"/> The Scripture ſpeaks clearly, roundly, and fully to this, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.5, 6, 8. <hi>The Lord thy God will bring thee into thine own Land, and the Lord thy God will circumciſe thine heart, and the heart of thy ſeed, to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and thou ſhalt return and obey the voice of the Lord, and do All His Commandements.</hi> This gracious Promiſe was made to the <hi>Jews,</hi> above two thouſand years ago, and yet to this very day it hath not been fulfilled; and therefore there will certainly come a time wherein God will make it good, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.6. <hi>The Wolf ſhall dwell with the Lamb, &amp;c. and they ſhall not hurt, &amp;c. for the Earth ſhall bee Full of the Knowledge of The Lord, As the Waters Cover The Sea.</hi> This glorious Promiſe hath not been made good to this day, but there is a time a coming wherein it ſhall bee accompliſhed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.8. <hi>There ſhall bee a high-way, and it ſhall bee called a way of Holineſs,</hi> THE UNCLEAN SHALL NOT PASSE OVER IT, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.21. <hi>This is my Covenant, my</hi> WORD AND MY SPIRIT SHALL NEVER DEPART <hi>from thee for ever,</hi> Iſa. 60.21. <hi>Thy People ſhall bee</hi> ALL RIGHTEOUS, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40, 41. <hi>I will make an everlaſting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good.

                     <p>Now it is very obſervable, that this great Promiſe muſt bee fulfilled, when the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall return, and bee ſettled in their own Land.

                     <p>The ſeventh and laſt Propoſition, is this, That though the people of God ought to bee holy at all times, yet there are ſome ſpecial times and ſeaſons wherein God calls aloud for holineſs, more than hee doth at other times, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee looks, and expects that his people ſhould be eminently holy, as well as really holy.</p>

After great falls God expects and looks that his people ſhould bee more fearful of ſin than ever, and more careful of pleaſing and honouring of him than ever, and more reſolute in reſiſting of temptations than ever, and more conſtant and abundant in a way of duty, than ever, and more thankful and fruitful under mercies, than ever, and more quiet and ſilent under afflictions than ever, and more ſtout and couragious in the face of all oppoſition than ever, &amp; more wiſe and circumſpect in their walkings than ever, and more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and diligent to prevent &amp; avoid future falls than ever; how elſe will the honour of God bee repaired, and the glory of Religion bee vindicated, and the Credit of the Goſpel be raiſed, and the grieved Saints bee rejoyced, and young begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in Religion be afreſh incouraged, and ſecure ſinners bee awakened, convinced and converted. But</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When God ſhews ſingular mercy to his people, and when hee doth great things for his people, then hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects and looks that his people ſhould bee a holy people, and then hee calls loudeſt for Holineſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.3, 4, 5. <hi>And Moſes went up unto God, and the Lord called unto him out of the Mountain, ſaying, Thus ſhalt thou ſay to the houſe of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, and tell the children of Iſrael, Yee have ſeen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bare you upon Eagles wings, and brought you unto my ſelf.

<pb n="651" facs="tcp:104351:320"/> her wings; ſo that there is no hurting, nor harming, nor no killing of them, but by ſhooting through the body of the old one; other Birds carry their young ones in their talons, and ſo expoſe them to danger, but the Eagle carries hers upon her wings, that they may bee ſafe and ſecure. <hi>Moſes,</hi> to ſhew how choice and chary God was of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and how much hee ſtood upon their ſafety and ſecurity tells them, that he carried them upon Eagles wings; that ſo none of their enemies might ruine or deſtroy them, yea that they might not ſo much as in the leaſt hurt or harm them; hee carried them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and hee carried them through the Red-Sea ſweetly, ſwiftly, ſtrongly, and tenderly, as the Eagle carried her young ones when danger is at hand. Now God having expreſt ſuch love, ſuch care, ſuch bowels, ſuch tenderneſs, ſuch ſweetneſs, and ſuch kindneſs to his people; hee looks and expects that they ſhould bee a holy people, and therefore hee ſtrongly urges them to obey Gods voice indeed, and to keep his Covenant; now what is it for a man to obey Gods voice indeed, and to keep his Covenant, out to bee really holy, yea to be eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy, So in that 10th. of <hi>Deut.</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi> had made a large Narrative of the ſingular favours and mercies of God to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the eleven firſt verſes of that chapter; hee falls in the 12, and 13. verſes upon preſſing of them to bee a holy people.

Now God would have his people thus to keep his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his Statutes, and this God would have them to do upon the account of thoſe high acts of favour and grace, that hee had ſhewed unto them; and thus to keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and his Statutes; what is it but to be a holy people, yea to be a very holy people unto the Lord? And ſo in that <hi>Ezra.</hi> 9.13, 14. <hi>Seeing that thou our God haſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us leſs than our iniquities deſerve, and haſt given us ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance as this, ſhould wee again break thy Commandements, and joyn in affinity with the people of theſe abominations? wouldeſt thou not bee angry with us, till thou haſt conſumed us, ſo that there ſhould bee no remnant, nor eſcaping?</hi> Free and rich mercy calls hardeſt and loudeſt for duty, the more merciful God hath been to his people, the more fearful they ſhould be of offending of him, and the more careful they ſhould be in pleaſing of him, Divine bleſſings ſhould be the greateſt obligations in the world upon a Chriſtian to keep at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from ſin, and to keep cloſe to a holy God; the greater the mercy is, and the more miraculous the deliverance and the ſalvation is, that God crowns his people with, the greater are the ingagements that God hath put upon them to be a holy people to him. So in that 116. <hi>Pſal. David</hi> gives in a bill of particulars in the eight firſt verſes, hee gives you a choice Narrative of the ſingular favours and bleſſings of God both in reſpect of his inward, and his outward man; God had been good to his ſoul, and hee had been kind to his body; hee tells you of Gods ſparing mercy, and of his preventing mercy, and of his preſerving mercy, and of his delivering mercy, and of his ſupporting mercy, and of his multiplying mercy, and of his pardoning mercy; hee tells you that God hath heard his prayers, and wip'd off his tears, and preſerved his feet from falling, and his ſoul from death. And then in the following words hee tells you what his reſolution is, upon the whole. <hi>I will walk before the Lord in the Land of the Living,</hi> verſ. 9. or rather as the Hebrew hath it <hi>(Ethhallech Liphne Jehovah) I will walk before the face of the Lord;</hi> The Hebrew word that is here rendred walk, ſignifies a continued action,
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:104351:321"/> or the reiteration of an action. <hi>David</hi> reſolves that hee will not only take a turn or two with God, or walk a pretty way with God, as <hi>Orpah</hi> did with <hi>Ruth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ruth 1.10,— 15.</note> and then take his leave of God, as <hi>Orpah</hi> did of her Mother; but hee reſolves what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever comes on it, that hee will walk conſtantly, reſolutely, and perpetually before God, or before the face of the Lord; Now walking before the face of the Lord, doth imply a very exact, circumſpect, accurate, and preciſe walking before God; and indeed no other walking is either ſuitable, or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the eye of God. But is this all that hee will do upon the receipt of ſuch ſignal mercies? O no! for hee reſolves to take the cup of ſalvation, and to call upon the Name of the Lord, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o offer the ſacrifice of thankſgiving, <hi>v.</hi> 13. and 17. but is this all that hee will do? oh no! for hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves that hee will preſently pay his vows unto the Lord in the preſence of all his people, <hi>v.</hi> 14, and 18. but is this all that hee will do? O no! for hee reſolves that hee will love the Lord better than ever, and more than ever, <hi>v.</hi> 1. Hee loved God before with a real love, but having now received ſuch rare mercies from God, hee is reſolved to love God with a more raiſed love, and with a more inflamed love, and with a more active and ſtirring love, and with a more growing and increaſing love than ever. And ſo the Apoſtle, in that <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1, 2. <hi>I beſeech you therefore, Brethren, by the mercies of God, that you preſent your bodies a living ſacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable ſervice. And bee not conformed to this world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but bee yee tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the renewing of your mind, that yee may prove what is the good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.</hi> When this great Apoſtle would work up the <hi>Romans</hi> to a full reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of themſelves to God, and to his ſervice, and would ſence and arm them againſt the ſinful faſhions, cuſtomes, examples, diſpoſitions and practices of a corrupt and wicked world; hee ſets the mercies of God before them; the Apoſtle very well knew that there was no ſuch ſpur to holineſs, nor no ſuch preſervative againſt wickedneſs as this was; the Apoſtle could have ſet threatnings before them, and the curſe before them, and wrath before them, and former and latter judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:104351:322"/> before them, and hell before them, and yet hee paſſes over all theſe things, and preſents the mercies of God before them, as the moſt effectual means under Heaven to engage them to holineſs, and to fortify them againſt all ſinful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and worldly vanity. O Sirs! you are all under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſignal mercies this day; you are out of Hell, and is not that a ſignal mercy? you have many mercies that others want, and is not that a ſignal mercy? yet God rains <hi>Mannah</hi> every day about your Tents, when others wander ſeveral miles, and are too often put off with ſtones inſtead of bread, and is not that a ſignal mercy? That wicked mens hearts ſhould be ſo full of wrath, rage, revenge, envy and malice, and you caſt at their feet, and yet not trod to death, is a ſignal mercy; that you ſhould ſtand when others fall, that you ſhould be faithful, when others are falſe, that you ſhould perſevere, when others backſlide, that you ſhould be for God, when ſo many are for <hi>Baal,</hi> and that you ſhould be followers of the Lamb, when ſo many thouſands are dancing after Antichriſts Pipes, are all very rare and ſignal mercies, and calls aloud upon you to be holy, yea to be eminently holy, &amp;c. But</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Times of perſonal afflictions, are times wherein God calls aloud for holineſs, when the Rod of God is upon our backs,<note place="margin">See my <hi>Mute Chriſtian</hi> under the Smarting Rod, &amp;c.</note> it highly concerns us to look that our words are full of grace, and that all our waies and works are full of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. Now God looks that his people ſhould be divinely fearful of offending him, and divinely careful in pleaſing of him, and divinely willing to reſign up themſelves to him, and divinely patient in waiting on him, and divinely humble in ſubmitting to him, and divinely wiſe in juſtifying of him, and divinely reſolute in ſerving of him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. But hee afflicts us for our profit, that wee might be made partakers of his holineſs; why they were before partakers of his holineſs, that's true; and theſe words declare that the great reach and deſign of God in all the afflictions that hee brings upon his people, is to make them more and more holy; and therefore for Chriſtians to be proud under the Rod, and carnal under the Rod, and worldly under the Rod, and froward under the Rod, and ſtupid under the Rod, and wanton under the Rod,
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:104351:322"/> and wicked under the Rod, is to croſs and fruſtrate the great deſign of God in afflicting of them. In afflictions God looks that his people ſhould ſhine brighter and brighter, and grow better and better, and holier and holier; O there is nothing that pleaſes God more, that delights God more, that affects God more, or that wins upon God more, than to ſee his people a holy people in the daies of their afflictions,<note place="margin">Well-waters are hotteſt in the winter, &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.2, 3. <hi>Go, and cry in the ears of Jeruſalem, ſaying, Thus ſaith the Lord, I remember thee, the kindneſs of thy youth, the love of thine Eſpouſals, when thou wenteſt after mee in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in a Land that was not ſown. Iſrael was holineſs unto the Lord, and the firſt-fruits of his increaſe: all that devour him ſhall offend; evil ſhall come upon them, ſaith the Lord.</hi> God was wonderfully affected and taken with the love of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and with the kindneſs of his people, and with the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his people, when they were in their wilderneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Look as ſtars ſhine brighteſt in the darkeſt nights, and as Torches are the better for beating, and Spices the ſweeter for pounding, and young Trees the faſter rooted for ſhaking, and Vines the more fruitful for bleeding, and Gold the more glittering for ſcouring: So God looks that his childrens graces ſhould ſhine brighteſt in the darkeſt nights of afflictions, hee looks that his children ſhould be the better for his Fatherly beating, and the ſweeter for being pounded in the morter of affliction, and the faſter rooted in grace and holineſs, by all divine ſhakings, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In times of affliction God looks that his children ſhould be true <hi>Salamanders</hi> that live beſt in the fire. Where afflictions hangs heavieſt, hee looks that there corruptions ſhould hang looſeſt; hee looks that that grace and holineſs which lies hid in nature, as ſweet water doth in Roſe leaves, ſhould then be moſt fragrant when the fire of affliction is put under to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil it out, &amp;c. But</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, When perſons that are under a great Profeſſion, or in Church Communion, ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="656" facs="tcp:104351:323"/> ſo looſely, and vainly, as that they occaſion the Name of God to be blaſphemed,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.21, 22, 23.</note> Religion to be ſcorned, the Goſpel to be deſpiſed, Profeſſion to be abhorred, the Saints to be reviled, and young comers on to be diſcouraged, and the ungodly in their wickedneſs to be hardened and confirmed. O this is a time wherein God calls aloud upon his people to be holy! O now God expects an extraordinary meaſure of holineſs in his people! O now hee looks that his people ſhould rather walk like Angels, than live like Saints, that ſo they may in ſome meaſure repair, and make up the ſad breaches that have been made upon his honour, and the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of Religion, and that they may live Profeſſion into ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and eſteem once more in the world. Such bleſſed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects as theſe, the horrid ſin of the inceſtuous perſon did oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally work in the hearts and lives of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as you may ſee by comparing the Scriptures in the Margint to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.1, 2, 3. 2 Cor. 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. &amp; ch. 7.11.</note> O Sirs! in theſe daies are there not many that have made a very high Profeſſion, that have ſhined as the ſtars in the Firmament, who are now fallen from their Profeſſion, from their Principles, and from all things that are good? How many now do build the things that they have deſtroyed? what betraying of Chriſt, what betraying of Truth, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying of Saints is there this day among many that have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended very high to Religion? how many now approve of thoſe things that before they would never own, and that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie thoſe things now that they have formerly condemned, and that comply with thoſe things now that formerly they have abhorred, yea that contend for thoſe things now for which they have formerly ſuffered; and therefore certainly theſe are the very times wherein God calls aloud upon his people to be holy, yea to be eminently holy, &amp;c.

O Sirs! remember that in all your publick duties God calls aloud for holineſs, and in all your family duties God calls aloud for holineſs, and in all your cloſet duties God calls aloud for holineſs; times of drawing neer to God ſhould be alwaies times of much holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; you may come to a duty, but you will never come to God in a duty without holineſs; you may come to an Ordinance but you will never come to God in an Ordinance without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; and therefore in all your drawings nigh to God, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that God calls for holineſs in a ſpecial manner then. But</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, When God eminently appears in the execution of his judgements upon wicked and ungodly men; O that is a time that God calls aloud for holineſs, when hee is a raining Hell out of Heaven upon unholy perſons; God now lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And I ſaw as it were a Sea of glaſs, mingled with fire, and them that had gotten the victory over the Beaſt, and over his Image, and over his Mark, and over the number of his Name, ſtand on the Sea of glaſs, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the harps of God. And they ſing the ſong of Moſes the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, and the Lamb, ſaying, Great and marvelous are thy works Lord God Almighty, just and true are thy waies thou King of Saints. Who ſhall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorifie thy Name? for thou onely art holy; for all Nations ſhall come and worſhip before thee, for thy judgements are made manifeſt.</hi> In this and the following chapters the utter overthrow of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt is deſcribed. In this chapter you have a new Viſion of the Goſpels reſtoring, and of Antichriſts ruine. By the Sea of glaſs mingled with fire, wee are to underſtand the fiery trials, and dreadful perſecutions by fire and faggot that Antichriſt will inflict upon ſincere and faithful Chriſtians. The alluſion is to the Red Sea, and <hi>Pharaohs</hi> perſecuting of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but the addition of fire is plainly to diſtinguiſh the Popes perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution from <hi>Pharaohs;</hi> for though <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did ſorely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the people of God both in their liberties and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and though hee had plotted and contrived a way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their male children, yet hee was never ſo cruel, hee was never ſo bloody as to burn the people of God with fire and faggot, as Antichriſt hath done in all ages. But now mark, when the vials of the wrath of God comes to be poured out upon Antichriſt, yea upon what ever ſmells of Antichriſt, or looks like Antichriſt, why then the people of God will in a very eminent way lift up God as the great object of their fear, and then the generality of the Nations ſhall be ſo deeply affected with the dreadful amazing and aſtoniſhing judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:104351:324"/> of God upon Antichriſt, that they ſhall repent, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, and give glory to him. O Sirs! when God ſtrikes ſlaves, Sons ſhould tremble; great judgements upon ſinners ſpeaks out a great deal of the juſtice and holineſs of God; and the more the juſtice and holineſs of God appears, the more holy his people ſhould grow. Ah Chriſtians! had you grown more holy by thoſe ſevere judgements of God, that hath been inflicted upon others before your eyes, you had not been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe ſmart rebukes of God that now you are under this day. But</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, When men are called forth to war by God, O! that's a ſpecial time and ſeaſon wherein God calls aloud for holineſs. The man of war muſt have holineſs written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bridles of the horſes, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.20. When men carry their lives in their hands, they had need of holineſs in their hearts; when in every encounter a man muſt expect to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon a ſtate of eternity; hee had need be very holy, that ſo if hee ſhould fall in the encounter,<note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> lived more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly in time of war, than in the times of their greateſt peace.</note> hee may be ſure to be happy, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.9, 14. <hi>When the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Mark, though the people of God were to keep themſelves from every wicked thing, at all other times, yet when they went out againſt their enemies, then in a ſpecial manner it highly concerned them to keep themſelves not from ſome, but from every evil thing, or rather as the Hebrew hath it, from every evil word, <gap reason="foreign">

When God findes holineſs in <hi>Iſraels</hi> Camp, then God will quickly give up <hi>Iſraels</hi> enemies into <hi>Iſraels</hi> hands; but when the Camp becomes a Den of iniquity, then God will depart from the Camp; and when God who is the bulwrk of a Camp, is departed, all the world cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Camp from being deſtroyed.<note place="margin">Rev. 17.14.</note> The Lamb looks that all thoſe brave hearts that ingage with him againſt Antichriſt, ſhould be called, and choſen, and faithful; there is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of proof to that of holineſs; let a man be never ſo well mounted, cloathed; armed, weaponed, yet if hee be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, hee lies naked and open to all diſaſters, calamities and miſeries.

That of <hi>Eleazer</hi> is very remarkable, who would not do any thing which might ſeem to bee evil, becauſe he would not ſpot his white head: O Sirs! when once the Gray hairs of holineſs and righteouſneſs are upon you, it highly concerns you to ſhun the very ſhews and appearances of evil, that ſo you may not ſpot nor ſtain the honour of your white head. I have read of <hi>Joſhua</hi> that valliant Souldier, that when hee was a young man, and in the prime and flower of his daies, when his bones were full of marrow, and his breaſts full of milk (as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks) that then hee was leaſt in vigour and valour for God, and how that ſometimes in caſes of eminent danger, hee would conceal himſelf, but when hee grew older, and found the ſtrength of nature declining and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying, then hee beſtired himſelf exceedingly for God: O Sirs! when you have one foot in the Grave, God calls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud upon you to beſtir your ſelves exceedingly for his honour and glory, and for your own internal and eternal welfare. <hi>Solon</hi> was not aſhamed to ſay that hee learned much in his old age. And <hi>Julianius</hi> (the Lawyer) was wont to ſay, that when hee had one foot in the Grave, hee would have the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the School: O Sirs! ſhall nature do more than grace, ſhall morality excel real piety? 'Twas the glorious commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Church of <hi>Thiatira,</hi> that her laſt works were more than her firſt; <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.19. <hi>I know thy works, and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſervice, and faith, and thy patience, and thy work, and the laſt to bee more than the firſt:</hi> O the happineſs! of
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:104351:327"/> that man that is beſt at laſt, that brings forth moſt of the fruits of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs in old age. O the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs of that man, whoſe Faith is more ſtrong at laſt than at firſt, and whoſe love is more inflamed at laſt than at firſt, and whoſe hopes are more raiſed and elevated at laſt than at firſt, and whole knowledge is more clear at laſt than at firſt, &amp; whoſe zeal is warmer at laſt than at firſt, and whoſe thoughts are more heavenly at laſt than at firſt, and whoſe heart is more ſpiritual at laſt than at firſt, and whoſe communion with God is more high at laſt than at firſt, and whoſe life is more holy at laſt than at firſt.</p>
                     <p>If there be any man in the world that is ripe for Heaven, and that injoyes a Heaven (in his own ſoul) on this ſide Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, this is the man whoſe graces, and whoſe gracious works are more at laſt than at firſt. Well Chriſtians, for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, the neerer death makes her approaches to you, the louder God calls upon you to be holy. And thus by a hand of grace, that hath been in mee, upon mee, and with me, I have ſhewed you what thoſe ſpecial times and ſeaſons are wherein God calls loudeſt for holineſs, and ſo according to my weak meaſure, I have given out all that the Lord hath graciouſly given in concerning that moſt neceſſary, that moſt noble, that moſt glorious, and that moſt uſeful point of points, <hi>viz.</hi> Holineſs; and therefore I have nothing more to do, but earneſtly to pray, that what hath been ſpoken and written, may be ſo bleſt from on high, that it may work mightily to the internal and eternal welfare both of Writer, Reader, and Hearer, that ſo when their Race is run, and their Work done here on earth, they may be everlaſtingly bleſt with a happy ſight of the Beatifical Viſion of God in Heaven. <hi>Amen.</hi>
